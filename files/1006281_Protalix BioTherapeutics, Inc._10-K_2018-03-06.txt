enable us develop recombinant therapeutic proteins yielding substantial cost advantages accelerated development competitive benefits compared mammalian cell-based protein expression systems In addition ProCellEx system may enable us certain cases develop commercialize recombinant proteins without infringing upon method-based patents intellectual property rights third parties The major elements ProCellEx system patent protected major countries Moreover expect enjoy method-based patent protection proteins develop using proprietary ProCellEx protein expression technology although

plant cell-based protein expression technology We also believe significant benefits ProCellEx system substantiated clinical trials successful commercialization taliglucerase alfa product candidates potential transform industry standard development complex therapeutic proteins Mammalian cell-based expression technology based introduction human gene encoding specific therapeutic protein genome mammalian cell systems become dominant system expression recombinant proteins due capacity sophisticated proper protein folding necessary proteins carry intended biological activity assembly

including Epogen Neupogen Cerezyme Rituxan Humira Enbrel Neulasta Remicade Herceptin produced mammalian cell-based expression systems Mammalian cell-based expression systems produce proteins superior quality efficacy compared proteins expressed bacteria yeast cell-based systems As result majority currently approved therapeutic proteins well development produced mammalian cell-based systems While bacterial yeast cell-based expression systems first protein expression systems developed biotechnology industry remain cost-effective compared mammalian cell-based production methodologies proteins expressed bacterial yeast cell-based systems lack capacity sophisticated protein folding assembly post-expression modifications key factors mammalian cell-based systems Accordingly systems cannot used produce glycoproteins complex proteins therefore bacterial yeast cell-based systems limited expression basic simple proteins insulin growth hormones 6 Several companies research institutions exploring

GMP inspections performed part respective reviews marketing approval taliglucerase alfa Competitive Advantages Our ProCellEx Protein Expression System We intend continue leverage multiple unique advantages proprietary ProCellEx protein expression system including advanced genetic engineering technology plant cell-based protein expression methods develop pipeline Significant advantages ProCellEx system mammalian bacterial yeast transgenic cell-based expression technologies include following Biologic Optimization ProCellEx internal capabilities developed improve biologic dynamics expressed protein For example proteins produced system uniform glycosilation patterns therefore require lengthy expensive post-expression modifications required certain proteins produced mammalian cell-based systems Such post-expression modifications mammalian cell-produced proteins made order expose terminal mannose sugar residues structures protein key elements allowing expressed protein bind target cell subsequently taken target cell therapeutic benefit In addition steps guarantee exposure required terminal mannose sugar residues resulting potentially lower effective yields inconsistency

biotherapeutic proteins available commercial sale protected patents cover compound available use public domain Rather process expressing protein product mammalian bacterial cell systems protected method-based patents Using plant cell-based protein expression technology able express equivalent protein without infringing upon method-based patents Moreover expect enjoy method-based patent protection proteins develop using ProCellEx system although assurance patents granted In cases may able obtain patent protection compositions proteins We filed U.S international composition matter patents PRX-102 certain product candidates Broad Range Expression Capabilities ProCellEx able produce broad array complex glycosilated proteins difficult produce systems bacterial yeast cell-based systems well CHO systems We successfully demonstrated feasibility ProCellEx system producing exploratory research scale variety therapeutic proteins belonging different classes recombinant drugs enzymes hormones monoclonal antibodies cytokines vaccines We demonstrated recombinant proteins expressed date intended composition correct biological activity human-equivalent protein several proteins demonstrating advantageous biological activity compared currently available biotherapeutics In specific cases successful expressing proteins successfully expressed production systems Significantly Lower Capital Production Costs ProCellEx entails lower cost scale-up production Plant cells grow rapidly variety conditions sensitive mammalian cells temperature pH oxygen levels generally grown near perfect conditions Our system therefore require highly complex expensive stainless steel bioreactors typically used mammalian cell-based production systems maintain specific temperature pH oxygen levels Instead use simple polyethylene bioreactors maintained room temperature clean-room placed This system also reduces ongoing production monitoring costs typically associated mammalian cell-based expression technologies Furthermore mammalian cell-based systems require costly growth media various stages production process achieve target yields proteins plant cells require simple much less expensive solutions based sugar water microelements infrequent intervals achieve target yields Mammalian cell-based expression systems require large quantities sophisticated expensive growth medium accelerate expression process 7 Elimination Risk Viral Transmission Infection Mammalian Components By nature plant cells carry risk infection human animal viruses Mammalian cells contrary susceptible viral infections including human viruses several cases viral contamination occurred As result risk contamination products development potential risk viral transmission product product candidates future patients whether known unknown mammalian viruses eliminated Because products product candidates bear risk mammalian viral transmission required FDA regulatory authorities perform constant monitoring procedures mammalian viruses protein expression process required mammalian cell-based production In addition production process ProCellEx system void mammalian components susceptible transmission prions related bovine spongiform encephalopathy commonly known mad-cow disease These factors reduce risks operating costs ProCellEx compared mammalian cell-based expression systems The FDA regulatory authorities require viral inactivation rigorous detailed procedures mammalian cell-based manufacturing processes order address potential hazards thereby increasing cost time demands expression systems Furthermore current FDA procedures ensure screening scientifically identified known viruses Accordingly compliance current FDA procedures fully guarantee patients protected transmission unknown new potentially fatal viruses may infect mammalian cells Potential ability administer active therapeutic proteins orally We using ProCellEx produce active recombinant proteins
