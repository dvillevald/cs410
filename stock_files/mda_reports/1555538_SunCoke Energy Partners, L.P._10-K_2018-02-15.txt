market dynamics Fluctuations benchmark price coal delivery northwest Europe referenced Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report API2 index price well Newcastle index coal prices referenced Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report API5 index price reflect high-ash coal prices shipped Australia contribute customers decisions place tons export market thus impact transloading volumes terminal facility Our KRT terminals serve two primary domestic markets metallurgical coal trade thermal coal trade Metallurgical markets primarily impacted steel prices blast furnace operating levels whereas thermal markets impacted natural gas prices electricity demand In 2017 global thermal coal prices continued rise nearly 100 per ton previous lows early 2016 resulting improved export economics CMT customers On spot basis average API2 API5 index prices 2017 improved 40 percent 36 percent respectively compared 2016 In 2017 metallurgical market conditions volumes generally favorable thermal market demand low due weak natural gas prices suppressed weather-related electricity demand.SeasonalityOur revenues cokemaking business much logistics business tied long-term take-or-pay contracts seasonal However cokemaking profitability tied coal-to-coke yields improve drier weather Accordingly coal-to-coke yield component profitability tends favorable third quarter Extreme weather conditions may also challenge operating costs production winter months domestic coke business KRT service demand fluctuates due changes domestic electricity markets Excessively hot summer weather cold winter weather may increase commercial residential needs heat air conditioning turn may increase electricity usage demand thermal coal therefore may favorably impact logistics business Additionally CMT service fluctuates global thermal coal prices end market demand Activity generally lower third quarter typically due lower European demand heat.Raw MaterialsMetallurgical coal principal raw material cokemaking operations All metallurgical coal used produce coke cokemaking facilities purchased third-parties We believe adequate supply metallurgical coal available U.S worldwide able supply coal cokemaking facilities without significant disruption coke production Each ton coke produced facilities requires approximately 1.4 tons metallurgical coal In 2017 purchased approximately 3.3 million

owned blast furnace steel companies utilizing by-product coke oven technology The international merchant coke market largely supplied Chinese Colombian Ukrainian producers among others though difficult maintain high quality coke export market coupled transportation costs coke imports U.S often economical.The principal competitive factors affecting cokemaking business include coke quality price reliability supply proximity market access metallurgical coals environmental performance Our oven design heat recovery technology play role factors Competitors include merchant coke producers well cokemaking facilities owned operated blast furnace steel companies In past technologies sought produce carbonaceous substitutes coke blast furnace While none proven commercially viable thus far monitor development competing technologies carefully We also monitor ferrous technologies direct reduced iron production DRI could indirectly impact blast furnace customers We believe well-positioned compete coke producers In 2017 Domestic Coke segment along SunCoke's cokemaking facilities accounted approximately 25 percent coke market capacity U.S Current production cokemaking business committed long-term take-or-pay contracts As result competition mainly affects ability obtain new contracts supporting development additional cokemaking capacity re-contracting existing facilities well sale coke spot market Our facilities constructed using proven industry-leading technology many proprietary features allowing us produce consistently higher quality coke competitors produce Additionally

summarizes principal legal regulatory requirements believe may significantly affect us.Permitting Bonding Permitting Process Cokemaking Facilities The permitting process cokemaking facilities administered individual states However main requirements obtaining environmental construction operating permits found federal regulations Once requirements satisfied state local agency produces initial draft permit Generally facility reviews comments initial draft After accepting rejecting facility comments agency typically publishes notice regarding issuance draft permit makes permit supporting documents available public review comment A public hearing may scheduled U.S Environmental Protection Agency EPA also opportunity comment draft permit The state local agency responds comments draft permit may make revisions final construction permit issued A construction permit allows construction commencement operations facility generally valid least 18 months Generally construction commences period many states allow period extended certain situations Air Quality Our cokemaking facilities employ Maximum Available Control Technology MACT standards designed limit emissions certain hazardous air pollutants Specific MACT standards apply door leaks charging oven pressure pushing quenching Certain MACT standards new cokemaking facilities developed using test data SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking facility located Vansant Virginia Under applicable federal air quality regulations permitting requirements may differ among facilities depending upon whether cokemaking facility located attainment area i.e one meets national ambient air quality standards NAAQS certain pollutants non-attainment unclassifiable area The status area may change time new NAAQS standards adopted resulting area change one status classification another In attainment area facility must install air pollution control equipment employ Best Available Control Technology BACT In non-attainment
