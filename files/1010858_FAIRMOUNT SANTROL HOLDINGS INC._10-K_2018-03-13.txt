Overview The silica sand industry consists businesses involved mining processing sale silica sand silica sand-based products Monocrystalline silica also referred silica industrial sand gravel silica sand quartz sand term applied sands gravels containing high percentage silica also known silicon dioxide SiO2 form quartz The low relative cost special properties monocrystalline silica chemistry purity grain size color inertness hardness resistance high temperatures make critical variety industries end-use markets including production molds cores metal castings glass production manufacturing building products In particular monocrystalline silica key input hydraulic fracturing techniques used development oil gas resource basins Frac Sand Extraction Processing Distribution Raw frac sand naturally occurring mineral mined processed While specific extraction method utilized depends primarily geologic conditions raw frac sand mined using conventional open-pit extraction methods The composition depth chemical purity sand also dictate processing method equipment utilized After extraction raw frac sand washed water remove fine impurities clay organic particles additional procedures used contaminants easily removable The final steps production process involve drying screening raw frac sand according mesh size Most frac sand shipped bulk processing facility customers truck rail barge Because transportation costs may represent significant portion overall delivered product cost shipping large quantities particularly shipping long distances provides significant cost advantage suppliers highlights importance rail barge access low cost delivery As result facility location logistics capabilities important consideration suppliers customers In addition believe time largest proppant customers would prefer consolidate purchases across smaller group suppliers robust logistics capabilities broad offering high performance proppants Oil Gas Proppant Market Advances oil gas extraction techniques horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing allowed significantly greater extraction oil gas trapped within shale formations The hydraulic fracturing process consists pumping fluids well pressures sufficient create fractures targeted hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation order increase flow rate hydrocarbons well A granular material called proppant suspended transported fluid fills fracture propping open high-pressure pumping stops The proppant-filled fracture creates conductive channel hydrocarbons flow freely formation wellbore surface Proppants therefore perform vital function promoting flow conductivity hydrocarbons well productive life In fracturing well operators select proppant transportable fracture compatible frac wellbore fluids permits acceptable cleanup frac fluids resist proppant flowback In addition proppant must resistant crushing earth closure stress reservoir temperature There three primary types proppant utilized hydraulic fracturing process raw frac sand coated sand manufactured ceramic beads Customers choose among proppant types based geology reservoir expected well pressures proppant flowback concerns product cost Given price differences various proppant products well-specific considerations E&P companies continually evaluating optimal mix lower-cost lower-conductivity frac sand higher-cost higher-conductivity coated sand ceramics order best address geology well maximize well productivity economic returns 8 Proppant Industry Demand Trends Over past decade E&P companies increasingly focused exploiting vast hydrocarbon reserves contained North America oil gas reservoirs Using advanced techniques horizontal drilling hydraulic fracturing North American production oil gas grown rapidly development horizontal drilling

drilling activity demand proppants Through 2014 growth use horizontal drilling utilizing hydraulic fracturing means extract hydrocarbons shale formations dramatically increased number oil gas rigs operating North America This increased drilling activity contributed substantial growth demand proppants 2009 2014 In 2015 2016 due increasing global supply oil slowing growth global oil demand crude oil prices experienced downward pressure caused various E&P companies reduce drilling capital programs resulting significantly reduced rig counts During 2017 United States horizontal land rig counts increased considerably average 400 rigs 2016 average 740 rigs 2017 This rise rig counts resulted increased drilling activity proppant demand 2017 Additionally average E&P companies oil field service companies refined well designs hydraulic fracturing techniques achieve efficient production These changes techniques increased demand proppants increasing proppant intensity associated finer grades proppant Shift drilling activity demand mix The level drilling activity oil gas impact demand proppant mix proppant sell In 2015 2016 lower crude oil prices caused E&P companies seek ways reduce short-term operating costs expense maximizing well performance result experienced reduced demand coated proppants As result increased drilling activity 2017 including wells prone flowback demand resin-coated proppants increased faster pace raw sand proppants Propel SSP also experienced significant growth 2017 commercial trial well sales Beginning late 2016 demand finer grades sand increased relative coarser grades trend continued throughout 2017 Volatility selling prices proppants The rapid decline oil gas prices occurred 2016 led reduced drilling activity reduced demand proppants reduced proppant pricing In 2017 demand proppant increased significantly response higher drilling activity proppant intensity As result supply demand dynamics proppant market balanced relative 2016
