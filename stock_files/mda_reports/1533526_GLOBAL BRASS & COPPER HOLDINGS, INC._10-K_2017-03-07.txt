LIFO AccountingThe metals component inventories valued last-in first-out LIFO basis comprises approximately 70 total inventory December 31 2016 2015 respectively The impact LIFO accounting financial results may significant respect period-to-period comparisons depending fluctuations inventory levels During 2016 2015 2014 certain domestic metal inventory quantities reduced resulting liquidation LIFO inventory layers The effect reduction increased cost sales 1.9 million 0.1 million 0.6 million 2016 2015 2014 respectively.Metal CostWe leading value-added converter fabricator processor distributor specialized non-ferrous products North America We generate profits conversion manufacturing fabrication metal end products taking advantage fluctuations price copper metals Our business model uses various methods substantially reduce financial impact fluctuations metal prices operating margins largely unaffected trends metal prices Nevertheless fluctuations metal prices impact total amount net sales cost shrinkage loss impact LIFO liquidations previously discussed working capital requirements.Shrinkage loss primarily loss metal occurs melting casting operations inherent part metal casting process While shrinkage loss rate low relative total volume metal cast cost shrinkage loss impact financial performance increases metal prices increase.Over last three years approximately 25 sales volumes made toll basis customers supply us metal charge processing conversion fee melt metal convert finished product For metal processed non-toll basis procure metal sell customer whereby charge conversion fee also metal replacement fee For non-toll sales use balanced book 39Table Contentsapproach discussed substantially reduce impact metal price movements earnings operating margins.Metal prices also impact investment working capital collection terms customers longer payment terms suppliers Therefore metal prices increase even number pounds processed change working capital requirements also increase When metal prices fall opposite occurs.Balanced BookThe majority sales volume non-toll customers To substantially reduce financial impact metal price volatility earnings operating margins non-toll sales use balanced book approach hedge impact metal price fluctuations The balanced book approach minimizes financial impact metal price movements period date order date shipment matching timing quantity price metal cost recovery component net sales made non-toll basis timing quantity price replacement metal purchases For non-toll sale seek achieve balanced book one following three mechanisms Metal sales replacement purchases price date shipment terms meaning metal sale price customer purchase price replacement metal supplier set date shipment The customer bears risk metal price changes date order date shipment Metal sales replacement purchases firm price basis meaning metal sale price customer fixed order date matching replacement purchase fixed price established metal supplier The supplier therefore bears risk metal price changes date order date shipment Metal sales firm price basis circumstances matching firm price replacement purchase unavailable situation execute forward purchase price date shipment terms entering financial derivative transaction form forward purchase contract The impact price changes date order date shipment previously required metal replacement purchase offset gains losses derivative contract The derivative counterparty bears risk metal price changes date order date shipment.In 2016 approximately 60 non-toll sales volumes 45 total unit shipments conducted price date shipment terms All non-toll unit sales volumes conducted firm price replacement purchases price date shipment replacement purchases plus derivative contract.Metal DerivativesAs discussed use derivative contracts support balanced book approach These derivative contracts designated hedges accounting purposes recorded fair value accordance Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements Disclosures ASC 820 Thus include unrealized realized gains
