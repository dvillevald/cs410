Affecting Comparability ResultsNitrogen Fertilizer Selling Prices Over last decade strong demand high capacity utilization increasing operating margins result higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment nitrogen production facilities resulted increase global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity As result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased quickly global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating current global oversupply market leading lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices A significant amount new nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 first half 2017 additional production capacity expected come line second half 2017 including significant increase production capacity located North America The new capacity increase supply We expect lower priced environment continue global supply demand become balanced combination continued demand growth supply reductions producers respond lower realized margins taking higher cost production facilities line.The U.S Gulf major global fertilizer pricing point due volume nitrogen fertilizer trades Through 2016 nitrogen pricing U.S Gulf declined often trading parity international pricing points due continued imports various exporting regions decreased North American buyer interest result greater global nitrogen supply availability Seasonal decreases agricultural demand combined delayed customer purchasing activity resulted multi-year lows nitrogen fertilizer selling prices second half 2016 During first quarter 2017 prices began increase supply demand balance tightened anticipation spring fertilizer demand planting growing season However first quarter progressed increased imports North American market increased fertilizer supply pressured selling prices downward quarter ended During second quarter 2017 anticipated demand failed materialize increased imports United States occurred first quarter 2017 continued second quarter negatively impacting selling prices.The greater global nitrogen supply availability resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted results three six months ended June 30 2017 The average selling price products three months ended June 30 2017 223 per ton compared 249 per ton three months ended June 30 2016 decrease 10 resulting decrease net sales gross margin approximately 149 million periods The average selling prices products six months ended June 30 2017 221 per ton compared 248 per ton six months ended June 30 2016 decrease 11 resulting decrease net sales gross margin approximately 264 million periods In addition direct impact lower selling prices periods declining prices customers tend delay purchasing fertilizer anticipation prices future lower current prices.In addition impact market conditions
