capacity utilization increasing operating margins result higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment nitrogen production facilities resulted increase global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity As result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased quickly global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating current global oversupply market leading lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices A significant amount new nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 additional production capacity expected come line 2017 including significant increase production capacity located North America The new capacity increase supply We expect lower priced environment continue global supply demand become balanced combination continued demand growth supply reductions producers respond lower realized margins taking higher cost production facilities line.The U.S Gulf major global fertilizer pricing point due volume nitrogen fertilizer trades Through 2016 nitrogen pricing U.S Gulf declined often trading parity international pricing points due excess global nitrogen supply result continued imports various exporting regions decreased North American buyer interest Seasonal
