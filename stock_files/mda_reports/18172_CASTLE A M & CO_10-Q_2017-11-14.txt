the Company's 27.1 million sale of all its inventory at its Houston and Edmonton facilities to an unrelated third party The sale of this inventory which was sold at a zero gross margin calculated as net sales less cost of materials was the result of a strategic decision to lower the Company's exposure to oil and gas market fluctuations Including that sale of inventory net sales for the nine months ended September 30 2016 from the Houston and Edmonton locations which were closed in February 2016 were 33.0 million Despite the closure of these two locations the Company posted an 8.1

period January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 compared to 323.8 million during the nine months ended September 30 2016 The 25.8 million or 8.0 decrease between the nine month periods is mainly due to the 27.1 million of cost of materials recognized on the sale of all inventory at the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities in the nine months ended September 30 2016 as discussed above Cost of materials exclusive of depreciation and amortization was 75.3 as a percent of net sales in the nine months ended September 30 2017 compared to 77.2 as a percent of net sales for the comparative prior year period While the percentage for the nine months ended September 30 2016 was impacted by the 27.1 million sale of the inventory at the Houston and Edmonton locations the decrease in the percentage

financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.44Table of ContentsPart II OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1 Legal ProceedingsThe Company is party to a variety of legal proceedings claims and inquiries including proceedings or inquiries by governmental authorities which arise from the operation of its business These proceedings claims and inquiries are incidental to and occur in the normal course of the Company's business affairs The majority of these proceedings claims and inquiries relate to commercial disputes with customers suppliers and others employment and employee benefits-related disputes product quality disputes with vendors and/or customers and environmental health and safety claims It is the opinion of management that the currently expected outcome of these proceedings claims and inquiries after taking into account recorded accruals and the availability and limits of our insurance coverage will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations financial condition or cash flows of the Company.Item 1A Risk FactorsThe following information updates and supercedes the information previously disclosed in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2016 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 7 2017 and in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30 2016 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9 2017 Our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments.We have substantial debt service obligations As of September 30 2017 we had approximately 256.8 million of total debt outstanding excluding capital lease obligations of 0.3 million all of which is secured The debt outstanding in order of priority was comprised of 87.3 million of borrowings against our new Revolving Credit and Security Agreement the New ABL Facility  165.9 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 7.00 Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind PIK Toggle Notes due 2022 the Second Lien Notes  including 2.3 million of restricted Second Lien Notes issued to certain members of management MIP Notes  and short-term borrowings of approximately 3.6 million under a local credit facility entered into by the Company s French subsidiary under which it may borrow against 100 of the eligible accounts receivable factored with recourse up to 6.5 million Euros the Foreign Line of Credit  Our substantial level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business including the following it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness which will reduce the funds available to use for operations and other purposes including potentially accretive acquisitions our ability to fund a change of control offer under our debt instruments may be limited our substantial level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited and our substantial level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to satisfy our debt obligations from our operations and available resources under the New ABL Facility Our ability to meet our expenses and make these principal and interest payments as they come due therefore depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic and other factors many of which we cannot control Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and our anticipated revenue and cash flow may not be realized either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs If we do not have enough funds we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt sell assets or borrow more funds which we may not be able to accomplish on terms acceptable to us or at all In addition the terms of existing or future debt agreements may 45Table of Contentsrestrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our existing debt service obligations and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements which may not be successful.Our total outstanding debt under our New ABL Facility the Second Lien Notes including MIP Notes and the Foreign Line of Credit has an aggregate principal amount of 256.8 million as of September 30 2017 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial business and other factors beyond our control Therefore we may not be able to maintain or realize a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal premium if any and interest on our indebtedness If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations we may be forced to reduce or delay investments capital expenditures or potentially accretive acquisitions sell assets seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants which could further restrict our business operations The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives In addition any failure to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness or the terms thereof These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.Our debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results.Our debt agreements impose and future debt agreements may impose operating and financial restrictions on us These restrictions limit or prohibit among other things our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock pay dividends redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments make certain investments or acquisitions grant or permit certain liens on our assets enter into certain transactions with affiliates merge consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain of our subsidiaries transfer sell or acquire assets and change the business we conduct.These covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general engage in business activities including future opportunities that may be in our interest and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness If a default occurs in certain circumstances the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and may not be able to continue our operations as planned 46Table of ContentsOur future operating results are impacted by the volatility of the prices of metals which could cause our results to be adversely affected.The prices we pay for metal raw materials and the prices we charge for products may fluctuate depending on many factors including general economic conditions both domestic and international competition production levels import duties and other trade restrictions and currency fluctuations To the extent metal prices decline we would generally expect lower sales pricing and possibly lower operating income Depending on the timing of the price changes and to the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our metal raw materials prices our operating results may be adversely affected In addition because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short lead-times and the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or in some cases losses either of which could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain provisions of our debt instruments as well as result in us incurring impairment charges.The Company s actual financial results may vary materially from the projections that it filed with the bankruptcy court in connection the confirmation of the Company s plan of reorganization.In connection with the disclosure statement the Company filed with the bankruptcy court and the hearing to consider confirmation of its plan of reorganization the Company prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and its ability to continue operations upon its emergence from bankruptcy Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been and will not be updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors At the time they were prepared the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning the Company s anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections As a result investors should not rely on these projections.The Company s financial condition and results of operations for periods after the effective date of the Company s plan of reorganization are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to the effective date of the Company s plan of reorganization and historical financial information may not be indicative of the Company s future financial performance.On August 31 2017 the effective date of the Company s plan of reorganization the Company adopted fresh-start reporting as a result of the bankruptcy reorganization as prescribed in accordance with GAAP and the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 852 Reorganizations As required by fresh-start reporting the Company s assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value by allocating the reorganization value determined in connection with the plan of reorganization Accordingly the Company s financial condition and results of operations from and after the effective date of the Company s plan of reorganization are not comparable in various material respects to the financial condition and results of operations prior to the effective date of the Company s plan of reorganization Further as a result of the implementation of the Company s plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby the Company s historical financial information may not be indicative of its future financial performance Our common stock is now traded on the OTCQB  Venture Market the OTCQB  which could have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and could involve additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.The Company s Common Stock is presently traded on the OTC Markets under the ticker CTAM  The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than a national securities exchange may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our shareholders Securities traded in the OTC market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities the reduced number of market makers in the securities and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities As a result holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.Furthermore because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations general market conditions fluctuations in our operating results changes in the markets perception of our business and announcements made by us our competitors or parties with whom we have business relationships.47Table of ContentsBecause our common stock trades on the OTC market in some cases we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future Accordingly we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stockHolders of our Second Lien Notes can require us to repurchase their Second Lien Notes following a fundamental change which includes among other things the acquisition of more than 50 of our outstanding voting power by a person or group We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations.As of September 30 2017 we had approximately 256.8 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Notes Interest on the Second Lien Notes accrues at the rate of 5.00 except that the Company may in certain circumstances pay at the rate of 7.00 in kind Interest on the Second Lien Notes in the first 12 months is required to be paid in kind at a rate of 7.00 Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes which includes the acquisition of more than 50 of our outstanding voting power by a person or group we may be required to repurchase some or all of the Second Lien Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Second Lien Notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the relevant fundamental change repurchase date We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and in such circumstances may not be able to arrange the necessary financing on favorable terms or at all In addition our ability to satisfy such cash obligations will be restricted pursuant to covenants contained in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes and will be permitted to be paid only in limited circumstances We may also be limited in our ability to satisfy such cash obligations by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of default under the Second Lien Notes which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.The conversion of our Second Lien Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.Any issuance by us of our common stock upon conversion of our Second Lien Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders In addition any such issuance of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the average stock price during the period is greater than the conversion prices and exercise prices of the Second Lien Notes Furthermore any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Second Lien Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.We service industries that are highly cyclical and any downturn in our customers  industries could reduce our revenue and profitability.Many of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions energy prices consumer demand availability of adequate credit and financing customer inventory levels changes in governmental policies and other factors beyond our control As a result of this volatility in the industries we serve when one or more of our customers  industries experiences a decline we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries Historically we have made a strategic decision to focus sales resources on certain industries specifically the aerospace oil and gas heavy equipment machine tools and general industrial equipment industries A downturn in these industries has had and may in the future continue to have an adverse effect on our operating results We are also particularly sensitive to market trends in the manufacturing sectors of the North American economy In 2015 the downturn in the oil and gas sector had a significant impact on our financial results as sales to customers which operate in that market were significantly lower than they had been previously In February 2016 we announced the sale of all inventory from our Houston and Edmonton facilities that primarily serviced the oil and gas sector With this sale and the subsequent closure of the Houston and Edmonton facilities we significantly lowered our exposure to oil-related market fluctuations Going forward we will be primarily focused on two key industries aerospace and industrial A portion of our sales particularly in the aerospace industry are related to contracts awarded to our customers under various U.S Government defense-related programs Significant changes in defense spending or in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding or the timing of funding of those defense programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition The level of U.S spending for defense alternative energy and other programs to which such funding is allocated is subject to periodic congressional appropriation actions 48Table of Contentsincluding the sequestration of appropriations in fiscal years 2013 and after under the Budget Control Act of 2011 and is subject to change at any time.Our industry is highly competitive which may force us to lower our prices and may have an adverse effect on our operating results.The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive Competition is based principally on price service quality processing capabilities inventory availability and timely delivery We compete in a highly fragmented industry Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a regional and local basis some of which have greater financial resources than we do and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve We also compete to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to very large customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer increased services at a higher cost to us which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Our operating results are subject to the seasonal nature of our customers  businesses.A portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns Historically our revenues in the months of July November and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers Dependent on market and economic conditions our sales in the first two quarters of the year therefore can be higher than in the third and fourth quarters due to this seasonality As a result analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our operating results in one or more future quarters and consequently our operating results may fall below expectations.An additional impairment or restructuring charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating performance These actions could result in restructuring and related charges including but not limited to asset impairments employee termination costs charges for pension benefits and pension curtailments which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations We have a significant amount of long-lived assets We review the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance The results of these calculations may be affected by the current demand and any decline in market conditions for our products as well as interest rates and general economic conditions If impairment is determined to exist we will incur impairment losses which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards NOLs may be limited We have incurred substantial losses since 2008 We may not generate future taxable income so that we can use our available net operating loss carryforwards or NOLs as an offset As of September 30 2017 we had U.S federal NOLs of 213.5 million The U.S federal NOLs will expire in various years beginning with 2031 Due to the our bankruptcy proceedings a portion of these NOLs will be reduced relative to cancellation of indebtedness Additionally we have determined that an ownership shift of greater than fifty percent occurred in 2015 2016 and 2017 As such it is expected that a significant portion of the pre-ownership shift NOLs will be subject to a Section 382 limitation that will act to prevent the Company from utilizing all of its losses against future taxable income We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs As of September 30 2017 we have a full valuation allowance against our federal and state NOLs as we have concluded based on all available evidence that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these federal and state NOLs prior to their respective expiration.Disruptions or shortages in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to meet our customers  demands.Our business requires materials that are sourced from third party suppliers If for any reason our primary suppliers of metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of raw materials to us at competitive prices and in a timely manner our operating results could suffer Unforeseen disruptions in our supply bases could materially impact our ability to deliver products to customers The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting metals producers or suppliers may be unwilling or unable to meet our demand due to industry supply conditions If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials from our traditional suppliers we may not be able to obtain such raw materials from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules which could have an adverse impact on our operating results To the extent we have quoted prices 49Table of Contentsto customers and accepted orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials or have existing contracts we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers In some cases the availability of raw materials requires long lead times As a result we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials we may be unable to timely supply customers with sufficient quantities of products This could cause us to lose sales incur additional costs or suffer harm to our reputation all of which may adversely affect our operating results.Increases in freight and energy prices would increase our operating costs and we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices which may adversely affect our operating results.We use energy to process and transport our products The prices for and availability of energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions which are affected by political economic and regulatory factors beyond our control Our operating costs increase if energy costs including electricity diesel fuel and natural gas rise During periods of higher freight and energy costs we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products In addition we typically do not hedge our exposure to higher freight or energy prices.We operate in international markets which expose us to a number of risks.Although a majority of our business activity takes place in the United States we serve and operate in certain international markets which exposes us to political economic and currency related risks including the following potential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies laws and regulations difficulty staffing and managing geographically diverse operations and the application of foreign labor regulations restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply currency exchange rate risk and changes in duties and taxes In addition to the United States we operate in Canada Mexico France the United Kingdom Singapore and China An act of war or terrorism or major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules cause additional delays in importing or exporting products into or out of any of these countries including the United States or increase the costs required to do so In addition acts of crime or violence in these international markets could adversely affect our operating results Fluctuations in the value of the U.S dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements which could reduce our stockholders  equity If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.Political and economic uncertainty arising from the outcome of the recent referendum on the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.On June 23 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union the EU  which triggered short-term financial volatility including a decline in the value of the British pound in comparison to both the U.S dollar and the euro Before the United Kingdom leaves the EU a process of negotiation is required to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the EU The uncertainty before during and after the period of negotiation could have a negative economic impact and result in further volatility in the markets for several years Such ongoing uncertainty may result in various economic and financial consequences for businesses operating in the United Kingdom the EU and beyond During the period September 1 2017 through September 30 2017 approximately 0.3 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations in the United Kingdom and approximately 9.3 of our consolidated net sales were attributable to operations in Europe overall The Company and its various subsidiaries hold financial assets and liabilities denominated in British pounds including cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable and 50Table of Contentsthe future impacts of the United Kingdom s exit from the EU could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.A portion of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining units which may lead to work stoppages.As of September 30 2017 approximately 21 of our U.S employees were represented by the United Steelworkers of America USW  under collective bargaining agreements including hourly warehouse employees at our distribution centers in Cleveland Ohio and Hammond Indiana As these agreements expire there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to replace those that expire Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory we cannot predict how stable our relationships with the USW will be or whether we will be able to meet the USW requirements without impacting our operating results and financial condition The USW may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce Work stoppages and instability in our relationship with the USW could negatively impact the timely processing and shipment of our products which could strain relationships with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our operating results On October 1 2014 we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW which covers approximately 104 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland Ohio This agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2018 and our goal is to engage in early negotiations in the spring of 2018 to secure another four-year agreement and avoid disruption to the business Approximately 25 employees at our Hammond Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated in August 2016 and expires in August 2020.We rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them.We rely on mill or supplier certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metals received from our suppliers for resale and generally consistent with industry practice do not undertake independent testing of such metals We rely on our customers to notify us of any product that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplier or ordered by the customer Although our primary sources of products have been domestic suppliers we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate In the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill or supplier certifications or customer specifications we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers However such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub-standard products and possible losses of customers Moreover there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill or supplier certifications In such circumstances we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry or do not carry sufficient insurance.Our business could be adversely affected by a disruption to our primary distribution hubs.Our largest facilities in Cleveland Ohio and Hammond Indiana as well as our facility in Janesville Wisconsin serve as primary distribution centers that ship product to our other facilities as well as external customers Our business could be adversely impacted by a major disruption at any of these facilities due to unforeseen developments occurring in or around the facility such as damage to or inoperability of our warehouse or related systems a prolonged power or telecommunication failure a natural disaster environmental or public health issue or an act of war or terrorism on-site A prolonged disruption of the services and capabilities of these or other of our facilities could adversely impact our operating results Damage to or a disruption in our information technology systems could impact our ability to conduct business and could subject us to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws.Difficulties associated with the design and implementation of our enterprise resource planning ERP  or other information technology systems could adversely affect our business our customer service and our operating results.We rely primarily on one information technology system to provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results Difficulties associated with upgrades or integration with new systems could lead to business interruption that could harm our reputation increase our operating costs and decrease profitability In addition any significant disruption relating to our current information technology systems whether resulting from such things as fire flood tornado and 51Table of Contentsother natural disasters power loss network failures loss of data security breaches and computer viruses or otherwise may have an adverse effect on our business our operating results and our ability to report our financial performance in a timely manner.The success of our business depends on the security of our networks and in part on the security of the network infrastructures of our third-party vendors In connection with conducting our business in the ordinary course we store and transmit limited amounts of customer vendor and employee information including account or credit card information and other personally identifiable information Unauthorized or inappropriate access to or use of our networks computer systems or services whether intentional unintentional or as a result of criminal activity could potentially jeopardize the security of this confidential information A number of other companies have publicly disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their networks Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose employees customers or vendors A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our proprietary information or the information of our customers vendors or employees cause interruption in our operations or damage our computers or those of our customers or vendors which could expose us to claims from such persons or from regulators financial institutions or others with whom we do business any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches Security breaches including any breach related to us or the parties with which we have commercial relationships could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss litigation and possible liability We cannot give assurance that the security measures we take will be effective in preventing these types of activities We also cannot give assurance that the security measures of our third-party vendors including network providers providers of customer and vendor support services and other vendors will be adequate In addition to potential legal liability these activities may adversely impact our reputation or our revenues and may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services all of which could adversely impact our business Ownership of our stock is concentrated which may limit stockholders  ability to influence corporate matters.Following our bankruptcy the Company s ownership is concentrated among a small group of institutional investors and/or hedge funds and the Company s management team Certain directors their affiliates and/or any other concentrated ownership interests may have the voting power to substantially affect or control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters Such a concentration of control could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent a change in control or other business combinations that might be beneficial to us.We could be vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness which could hurt our operating results.We are exposed to various interest rate risks that arise in the normal course of business Market risk arises from changes in interest rates We currently finance our operations with both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings and the market value of our 165.9 million of fixed rate borrowings may be impacted by changes in interest rates In addition if in the future interest rates subsequently increase significantly it could significantly increase the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity Commodity hedging transactions may expose us to loss or limit our potential gains.We have entered into certain fixed price sales contracts with customers which expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in commodity prices As part of our risk management program we may use financial instruments from time-to-time to mitigate all or portions of these risks including commodity futures forwards or other derivative instruments While intended to reduce the effects of the commodity price fluctuations these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to losses Also should our counterparties to such transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.We may face risks associated with current or future litigation and claims.From time to time we are involved in a variety of lawsuits claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business These suits concern issues including contract disputes employment actions employee benefits taxes 52Table of Contentsenvironmental health and safety personal injury and product liability matters Due to the uncertainties of litigation we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending lawsuits and claims we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity although the resolution in any reporting period of one of more of these matters could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period Also we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or operating results We could incur substantial costs in order to comply with or to address any violations under environmental and employee health and safety laws which could adversely affect our operating results.Our operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations including laws and regulations governing materials we use and our facilities In addition certain of our operations are subject to international federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes Our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations including those concerning occupational injury and illness employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and over time we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated used handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes Currently unknown cleanup obligations at these facilities or at off-site locations at which materials from our operations were disposed could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified but which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or operating results.Potential environmental legislative and regulatory actions could impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows.Climate change regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas GHG  emissions is currently being considered in the United States as well as elsewhere globally As a metals distributor our operations do not emit significant amounts of GHG However the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions Any adopted future climate change and GHG regulations may impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers and indirectly impact our operations Until the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows.We have various mechanisms in place that may prevent a change in control that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.In August 2013 we elected by resolution of the Board of Directors to become subject to Section 3-803 of the Maryland General Corporation Law the MGCL  As a result of this election the Board of Directors was classified into three separate classes of directors with each class generally serving three-year terms Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms The provision for a classified board could prevent a party who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock from obtaining control of our Board of Directors until the second annual stockholders meeting following the date the acquiring party obtains the controlling interest The classified board provision could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and could increase the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions.In addition our charter and by-laws and the MGCL include provisions that may be deemed to have anti-takeover effects and may delay defer or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider to be in their best interests For example the MGCL our charter and bylaws require the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter to amend our charter unless our Board of Directors has unanimously approved the amendment in which case the approval of the holders of a majority of such votes is required and contain certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to our Board of Directors Furthermore we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the MGCL that prohibit us from engaging in a business combination  with an interested stockholder  for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an interested stockholder unless the business combination or stockholder interest is approved in a prescribed manner The application of these and certain other provisions of our charter or the MGCL could have 53Table of Contentsthe effect of delaying or preventing a change of control which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.The provisions of our debt instruments also contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions In addition the repurchase rights in our Second Lien Notes triggered by the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes and the additional shares of our common stock by which the conversion rate is increased in connection with certain fundamental change transactions as described in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes could discourage a potential acquirer.Item 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds On the Effective Date by operation of the Plan the Company issued an aggregate of 3,734,385 shares of its new common stock as follows 1,300 shares were issued to the holders of Prepetition Second Lien Secured Claims as defined by the Plan in partial satisfaction of their claims pursuant to an exemption from the
