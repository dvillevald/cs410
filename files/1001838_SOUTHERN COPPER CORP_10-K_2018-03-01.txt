indicative future results This discussion contains forward-looking statements based management's current expectations estimates projections business operations Our actual results may differ materially currently anticipated expressed forward-looking statements result number factors See Item 1 Business Cautionary Statement EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW Business Our business primarily production sale copper In process producing copper number valuable metallurgical by-products recovered also produce sell Market forces outside control largely determine sale prices products Our management therefore focuses value creation copper production cost control production enhancement maintaining prudent capital structure remain profitable We endeavor achieve goals capital spending programs exploration efforts cost reduction programs Our aim remain profitable periods low copper prices maximize financial performance periods high copper prices We one world's largest copper mining companies terms production sales principal operations Peru Mexico We also active ongoing exploration program Chile Argentina Ecuador In addition copper produce significant amounts metals either by-product copper process number dedicated mining facilities Mexico In 2017 invested 1,023.5 million capital programs along 28.8 million exploration efforts We believe commitment growth continue benefit Company investors neighboring communities countries operate We believe hold world's largest copper reserve position At December 31 2017 copper ore reserves calculated copper price 2.90 per pound totaled 70.6 million tons contained copper following locations Copper contained ore reserves Thousand tons Mexican open-pit 31,286 Peruvian operations 24,421 IMMSA 233 Development projects 14,685 Total 70,625 Outlook Various key factors affect outcome These include limited following Changes copper molybdenum silver zinc prices In 2017 average LME COMEX per pound copper prices 2.80 approximately 27 higher 2016 In 2017 per pound LME spot copper prices ranged 2.48 3.27 Average zinc molybdenum prices 68 Table Contents increased 2017 37.9 26.6 respectively compared 2016 The average silver price decreased 0.4 2017 compared 2016 Sales structure In last three years approximately 80 revenues came sale copper 5 molybdenum 5 silver 4 zinc 6 various products including gold sulfuric acid materials Copper During last quarter LME copper price increased significantly average 2.40 per pound fourth quarter 2016 3.09 per pound fourth quarter 2017 average 3.21 per pound January 2018 We believe price improvement result synchronized economic growth recovery major economies We believe world economy accelerating growth expected 3.9 2018 China world's largest copper consumer 45 demand expected continue growth line estimated 6.8 GDP increase 2017 For global refined copper demand 2018 expect growth 2.1 amounts approximately 500,000 tons new copper demand With respect copper supply expect weak response result consistent decline investments several companies recent years Additionally labor unrest excess government taxation technical difficulties affecting production As result factors expect supply growth approximately 1 2018 yielding copper market deficit year give strong support copper prices Silver We believe silver prices support due industrial uses well perceived value shelter times economic uncertainty Silver represented 4.3 sales 2017 Molybdenum It 5.3 sales 2017 Molybdenum prices averaged 8.72 per pound fourth quarter 2017 compares 6.58 year ago 32.5 increase January 2018 prices averaged 11.54 per pound Molybdenum mainly used production special alloys stainless steel require significant hardness corrosion heat resistance A new use metal lubricants sulfur filtering heavy oils shale gas production Zinc It good long term fundamentals due significant industrial consumption expected production Through 2017 zinc inventories decreased 50 major warehouses improving metal's price support Zinc represented 4.9 sales 2017 Production In 2018 commence production new Toquepala concentrator expect able produce 931,000 tons copper 6 increase 877,000 tons produced 2017 We also expect produce 17.5 million ounces silver 10 higher 2017 production 15.9 million ounces In 2018 expect produce 84,600 tons zinc mines 23 2017 production 68,665 tons result recovery production Santa Eulalia Santa Barbara mines Additionally expect produce 21,700 tons molybdenum increase 1.7 due additional production Buenavista recovery Peruvian operations 69 Table Contents Cost Our operating costs expenses three-years ended
