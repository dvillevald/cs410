interim consolidated financial statements of Nicholas Financial Inc including its subsidiaries the Company  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S GAAP  for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as amended in Article 10 of Regulation S-X Accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to ensure the information is not
misleading In the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the year ending March 31 2018 It is suggested that these consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31 2017 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 14 2017 The March 31 2017 consolidated balance sheet
included herein has been derived from the March 31 2017 audited consolidated balance sheet included in the aforementioned Form 10-K The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period Actual results could
differ from those estimates Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables and the fair value of interest rate swap agreements 2 Revenue Recognition Finance receivables consist of
automobile finance installment contracts Contracts  and direct consumer loans Direct Loans  Interest income on finance receivables is recognized using the interest method Accrual of interest income on finance receivables
is suspended when a loan enters bankruptcy status is contractually delinquent for 61 days or more or the collateral is repossessed whichever is earlier Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts are accounted for under the cost-recovery method Interest
income on Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts does not resume until all principal amounts are recovered see Note 4 A dealer discount represents the
difference between the finance receivable net of unearned interest of a Contract and the amount of money the Company actually pays for the Contract The discount negotiated by the Company is a function of the lender the wholesale value of the
vehicle and competition in any given market In making decisions regarding the purchase of a particular Contract the Company considers the following factors related to the borrower place and length of residence current and prior job status history in making installment payments for automobiles current income and credit history In addition the Company examines its prior experience with Contracts purchased from the dealer from which the Company is purchasing the Contract and the
value of the automobile in relation to the purchase price and the term of the Contract The entire amount of discount is amortized as an adjustment to yield using the interest method over the life of the loan The average dealer discount associated
with new volume for the three months ended December 31 2017 and 2016 was 6.89 and 6.87 respectively in relation to the total amount financed The average dealer discount associated with new volume for the nine months ended December 31 2017 and 2016 was 7.23 and 7.00 respectively The amount of future unearned income is computed as the product of the Contract rate the Contract term
and the Contract amount Deferred revenues consist primarily of commissions received from the sale of ancillary products These products include
automobile warranties roadside assistance programs accident and health insurance credit life insurance involuntary unemployment insurance coverage and forced placed automobile insurance These commissions are amortized over the life of the
contract using the interest method 5 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 3 Earnings Loss Per Share The Company has granted stock compensation awards with nonforfeitable dividend rights which are considered participating securities Earnings loss per share
is calculated using the two-class method as such awards are more dilutive under this method than the treasury stock method Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing net income loss allocated to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period which excludes the participating securities Diluted earnings loss per share includes the dilutive effect of additional potential
common shares from stock compensation awards Earnings loss per share have been computed based on the following weighted average number of common shares outstanding Three months endedDecember 31 In thousands except pershare amounts Nine months endedDecember 31 In thousands except pershare amounts 2017 2016 2017 2016 Numerator Net income loss 2,898 1,606 1,741 6,479 Less Allocation of earnings loss to participating securities 40 22 23 76 Net income loss allocated to common stock 2,858 1,584 1,718 6,403 Basic earnings loss per share computation Net income loss allocated to common stock 2,858 1,584 1,718 6,403 Weighted average common shares outstanding including shares considered participating

of common stock from stock options totaling 160,000 were excluded from the diluted earnings loss per share calculation for December 31 2016 because their effect is anti-dilutive 6 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 4 Finance Receivables Finance receivables consist of Contracts and Direct Loans and are detailed as follows In thousands December 31,2017 March 31,2017 Finance receivables gross contract 454,277 512,720 Unearned interest 137,594 160,853 Finance receivables net of unearned interest 316,683 351,867 Unearned dealer discounts 14,138 17,004 Finance receivables net of unearned interest and unearned dealer discounts 302,545 334,863 Allowance for credit losses 21,187 17,658 Finance receivables net 281,358 317,205 Contracts and Direct Loans each comprise a portfolio segment The following tables present selected information on the entire

Company aggregates Contracts into static pools consisting of Contracts purchased during a three-month period for each branch location as management considers these pools to have similar risk characteristics and are considered smaller-balance
homogenous loans The Company analyzes each consolidated static pool at specific points in time to estimate losses that are probable of being incurred as of the reporting date It has maintained historical
write-off information for over 10 years with respect to every consolidated static pool and segregates each static pool by liquidation which creates 7 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 4 Finance Receivables continued snapshots or buckets of each pool s historical write-off to liquidation ratio at five different points in each vintage pool s liquidation cycle These snapshots are then used to assist in determining the allowance for credit losses The five snapshots are tracked at liquidation levels of 20 40 60 80 and 100 These snapshots help us in determining the appropriate allowance for
credit losses The Company purchases Contracts from automobile dealers at a negotiated price that is less than the original principal amount being
financed by the purchaser of the automobile The Contracts are predominately for used vehicles As of December 31 2017 the average model year of vehicles collateralizing the portfolio was a 2010 vehicle The Company utilizes a static pool
approach to track portfolio performance If the allowance for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to maintain adequate reserves based on management s
evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio the composition of the portfolio and current economic conditions Such evaluation considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral economic
conditions historical loan loss experience management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for credit losses The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Direct Loans Three months endedDecember 31 In thousands Nine months endedDecember 31 In thousands 2017 2016 2017 2016 Balance at beginning of period 782 774 773 748 Current period provision 171 95 389 243 Losses absorbed 172 73 395 217 Recoveries 6 3 20 25 Balance at end of period 787 799 787 799 Direct Loans are typically for amounts ranging from 1,000 to 11,000 and are generally secured by a lien on an automobile watercraft or other permissible tangible personal property Much of Direct Loans are originated with current or former customers under the Company s automobile financing program The typical Direct Loan represents a better credit risk than
Contracts due to the customer s historical payment history with the Company however the underlying collateral is less valuable In deciding if to make a loan the Company considers the individual s credit history job stability income
and impressions created during a personal interview with a Company loan officer Additionally because most of the Direct Loans made by the Company to date have been made to borrowers under Contracts previously purchased by the Company the payment
history of the borrower under the Contract is a significant factor in making the loan decision As of December 31 2017 loans made by the Company pursuant to its Direct Loan program constituted approximately 2 of the aggregate principal
amount of the Company s loan portfolio Changes in the allowance for credit losses for both Contracts and Direct Loans were driven by current economic conditions and credit loss trends over several reporting periods which are utilized in
estimating future losses and overall portfolio performance A performing account is defined as an account that is less than 61 days past due We define
an automobile contract as delinquent when more than 25 of a payment contractually due by a certain date has not been paid by the immediately following due date which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements
or as a result of a deferral The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due as extended where applicable In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions The only modification of terms in those
circumstances is to advance the obligor s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest Accordingly we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings 8 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 4 Finance Receivables continued The following table is an assessment of the credit quality by creditworthiness In thousands December 31,2017 December 31,2016 Contracts Direct Loans Contracts Direct Loans Performing accounts 412,775 10,349 462,569 11,231 Non-performing accounts 27,053 217 36,980 280 Total 439,828 10,566 499,549 11,511 Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts 3,843 40 4,220 36 Finance receivables gross contract 443,671 10,606 503,769 11,547 A non-performing account is defined as an account that is contractually delinquent for
61 days or more and the accrual of interest income is suspended When an account is 180 days contractually delinquent the account is written off The delinquency table below represents both performing and
non-performing accounts however it does not include Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts Upon notification of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy the account is not modified to reflect the new repayment plan administered by
a court-appointed trustee The cost recovery method of accounting is used and the accrual of interest income is suspended The balance will be reduced as payments are received by the bankruptcy court In the event the debtors  balance has been
reduced by the bankruptcy court the Company will record a loss equal to the amount of principal balance reduction In the event an account is dismissed from bankruptcy the Company will decide based on several factors to begin repossession
proceedings or to allow the customer to begin making regularly scheduled payments The following tables present certain information regarding the

this existing Line which extended the maturity date to March 31 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1 floor on LIBOR The amendment also increased the beneficial ownership
limit from 20 to 30 and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending December 31 2017 On December 30 2016 the Company executed an amendment which increased the pricing of the Line to 350 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining
the 1 floor on LIBOR Prior to December 30 2016 the pricing on the Line was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR with a 1 floor on LIBOR Pledged
as collateral for this Line are all the assets of the Company The Line requires compliance with certain financial ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests As of December 31 2017 the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants The Company has a longstanding relationship with its lenders and believes
it is probable that it will be able to obtain financing from either its existing lenders or from other sources however we can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the Line past March 31 2018
or assuming that they will approve it that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing including but not limited to the issuance of equity or
debt however we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 6 Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company previously utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in expected cash flows attributable to interest rate risk The
interest rate swap agreements converted a portion of the floating rate debt to a fixed rate more closely matching the interest rate characteristics of finance receivables During the nine months ended December 31 2017 no new contracts were initiated and both interest rate swap contracts matured During the nine months
ended December 31 2016 no new contracts were initiated and no contracts matured On June 13 2017 an interest rate swap agreement with an
effective date of June 13 2012 a notional amount of 25.0 million and a fixed rate of interest of 1.00 expired On July 30 2017 an
interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of July 30 2012 a notional amount of 25.0 million and a fixed rate of interest of 0.87 expired 10 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 6 Interest Rate Swap Agreements continued The locations and amounts of loss and gain in income are as follows Three months ended

December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law TCJA  The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1 2018 The decrease in the
enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of 3.4 million in December
2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31 2017 The provision for income taxes increased to approximately 3.7 million for the three months ended December 31 2017 from approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended December 31 2016 The Company s effective tax rate increased to 456.48 for the three months ended December 31 2017 from 37.93 for the three months ended December 31 2016 The
provision for income taxes increased to approximately 4.4 million for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from approximately 4.0 million for the nine months ended December 31 2016 The Company s effective tax rate
increased to 164.70 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from 38.01 for the nine months ended December 31 2016 8 Fair Value
Disclosures The Company measures specific assets and liabilities at fair value which is an exit price representing the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date When applicable the Company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability under a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value These tiers include Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets Level 2 defined as inputs
other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable and Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs about which little or no market data exists therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 11 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 8 Fair Value Disclosures continued Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The Company estimates the fair value of interest rate swap agreements based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward
interest rate yield curve in effect as of the measurement period adjusted for nonperformance risk if any including a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of both the Company s credit risk and the counterparty s credit risk Accordingly the Company classifies interest rate swap agreements as Level 2 Fair Value Measurement Using(In thousands Description Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Fair Value Interest rate swap agreements December 31 2017 assets March 31 2017 assets 17 17 Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value The Company s financial instruments consist of cash finance receivables and the Line For each of these financial instruments the carrying value
approximates fair value Finance receivables net approximates fair value based on the price paid to acquire Contracts The price paid reflects
competitive market interest rates and purchase discounts for the Company s chosen credit grade in the economic environment This market is highly liquid as the Company acquires individual loans on a daily basis from dealers The initial terms of the Contracts generally range from 12 to 72 months The initial terms of the Direct Loans generally range from 12 to 72 months If
liquidated outside of the normal course of business the amount received may not be the carrying value Based on current market conditions any new or
renewed credit facility would contain pricing that approximates the Company s current Line Based on these market conditions the fair value of the Line as of December 31 2017 was estimated to be equal to the book value The interest rate

decided adversely to the Company would in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations 10 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Reclassifications The Company made certain
reclassifications to the 2016 statements of cash flows The amortization of deferred revenues decreased cash flows from operating activities by 1.342 million for 2016 and correspondingly increased cash flows from investing activities 13 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 10 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued Recent Accounting Pronouncements In August 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB  issued the Accounting Standards Update ASU  2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows Topic 230 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payment The new guidance focuses on making the Statement of Cash Flows more uniform for companies The amendments in
this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years Early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial statements and is in the process of analyzing its current presentation of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows At this time the Company does not
believe ASU 2016-15 will have a material impact In June 2016 the FASB issued the ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments Credit Losses Topic 326 Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments Among other things the amendments in this ASU require the measurement of all expected credit
losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to
better inform their credit loss estimates Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses The ASU also requires
additional disclosures related to estimates and judgments used to measure all expected credit losses The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15 2019 Early
application will be permitted for all organizations for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15 2018 The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the
consolidated financial statements and is collecting and analyzing data that will be needed to produce historical inputs into any models created as a result of adopting this ASU At this time we believe the adoption of this ASU will likely have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU
No 2016-02 Leases  intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions The ASU affects all companies and other organizations that lease assets such as real estate airplanes and manufacturing equipment The ASU will require organizations that lease assets referred to as lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases The
accounting by organizations that own the assets leased by the lessee also known as lessor accounting  will remain largely unchanged from current U.S GAAP ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years Early application is permitted While the Company has not specifically evaluated each lease agreement we anticipate upon adoption the Company will add the
impact of the full operating lease terms that meets the scope using the present value of future minimum lease payments to the balance sheet The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this ASU on the consolidated financial
statements In January 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-01 Financial Instruments Recognition
and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities which is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments by requiring equity investments other than equity method or consolidation to be measured at fair
value with changes in fair value recognized in net income public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes separate presentation of financial assets and financial
liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset i.e securities or loans and receivables on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements eliminating the requirement to disclose the fair value of
financial instruments measured at amortized cost for organizations that are not public business entities eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value
that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet and requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value
of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk also referred to as own credit  when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for
financial instruments This ASU is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years This ASU permits early adoption of the instrument-specific credit risk
provision While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of the pending adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements the Company does not believe it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements 14 Nicholas Financial Inc and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Continued Unaudited 10 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies continued In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU No 2014-09 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers Topic 606 The ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers The ASU and all subsequently issued clarifying
ASUs will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S GAAP when it becomes effective The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method On July 9 2015 the FASB approved the
deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year As a result ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period The ASU would permit public entities to adopt the ASU early but not before the original effective date i.e annual periods beginning after December 15 2016 The impact of the
standard is limited to a large extent due to Topic 606 including a scope exception for finance receivables Since substantially all of the Company s revenue streams are generated from activities that are outside the scope of the new standard the Company does not believe that this standard will have a material impact on the Company s financials The Company has begun analyzing in-scope contracts using the five-step process outlined in Topic
606 and expects to finalize our conclusion during the quarter ending March 31 2018 The Company does not believe there are any other recently
issued accounting standards that have not yet been adopted that will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements 15 ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS Forward-Looking Information This
report on Form 10-Q contains various statements other than those concerning historical information that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions as well as information currently available to

in this document the words anticipate  estimate  expect  will  may  plan believe  intend  and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements Although Nicholas Financial Inc including its subsidiaries the Company we us or our  believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct Such statements are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions including but not limited to the risk factors discussed under Item 1A Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Part II Item 1A Risk Factors  in this Form 10-Q Should one or more of these risks or
uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect actual results may vary materially from those anticipated estimated or expected Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the Company s operating
results are the availability of capital including the ability to access bank financing on favorable terms recently enacted proposed or future legislation and the manner in which it is implemented including the effect of changes in tax law such
as the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA  that was enacted on December 22 2017 fluctuations in the economy the degree and nature of competition and its effects on the Company s ability to maintain profit margins at
acceptable levels or generate net income at all fluctuations in interest rates demand for consumer financing in the markets served by the Company the Company s products and services increases in the default rates experienced on automobile
finance installment contracts Contracts  adverse regulatory changes in the Company s existing and future markets the Company s ability to expand its business including its ability to complete acquisitions and integrate the
operations of acquired businesses and to expand into new markets and the Company s ability to recruit and retain qualified employees All forward looking statements included in this report are based on information available to the Company on
the date hereof and the Company assumes no obligations to update any such forward looking statement You should also consult factors described from time to time in the Company s other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission including its reports on Forms 10-K 10-Q 8-K and annual reports to shareholders Litigation and Legal Matters See Item 1 Legal Proceedings  in Part II of this Form 10-Q Critical Accounting Policy The Company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses It is based on management s opinion of an amount that is
adequate to absorb losses incurred in the existing portfolio The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses based
on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio which includes the competitive environment that existed when the loan was acquired the composition of the portfolio and current economic conditions Such evaluation
considers among other matters the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral economic conditions historical loan loss experience management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that
warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance Because of the nature of the customers under the Company s Contracts and its
Direct Loan program the Company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative The Company segregates its Contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses All Contracts purchased by
a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool The Company pools Contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase Contracts in different geographic markets This method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the
Company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate The pools also allow the Company to evaluate the different levels of customer income stability and credit history and the types of vehicles purchased in each market In
analyzing a static pool the Company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the same branch office the competition at time of acquisition and current market and economic conditions Each static pool is analyzed monthly to
determine if the loss reserves are adequate and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary A consolidated static pool contains the static pools of all branches for a given quarter The Company analyzes each consolidated static
pool at specific points in time 16 The Company has been maintaining historical write-off information for
over 20 years with respect to every consolidated static pool segregating each consolidated static pool by liquidation and in effect creating snapshots of a pool s
write-off-to liquidation ratio at five different points in such pool s liquidation cycle These snapshots help the Company in determining the appropriate provision
for credit losses and subsequent allowance for credit losses The five snapshots are taken when the liquidation levels are at 20 40 60 80 and 100 The Company s allowance for credit losses incorporates recent trends that include the acquisition of longer term contracts and increased delinquencies
which the Company believes more closely depicts the amount of the allowance for credit losses needed to maintain an adequate reserve Management evaluates each static pool on an independent basis each quarter and accounts for such pool s term how far along the corresponding pool is in its liquidation cycle late charges the number of deferments and delinquency This information is based on the result each individual Contract The Company believes that this approach reflects the current
trends of incurred losses within the portfolio and better aligns the allowance for credit losses with the portfolio s performance indicators Contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual
Contract-by-Contract basis Individual Contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally based on the lesser of the applicable state maximum
interest rate if any or the maximum interest rate which the customer will accept In most markets competitive forces will drive down Contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual
Contract The Company does not anticipate any portfolio acquisitions in the near-term The Company utilizes the branch model which allows for Contract
purchasing to be done at the branch level The Company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which Contracts to purchase These guidelines are specific and are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Contracts that
the Company purchases have common risk characteristics The Company utilizes its District Managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines as well as approve underwriting exceptions The Company
also utilizes internal audit the IA  to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines Any Contract that does not meet our underwriting guidelines can be submitted by a branch manager for approval from the Company s District
Managers or senior management Introduction Pretax income for the three months ending December 31 2017 was 8 million In the month of December 2017 the Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of 3.4 million relating to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA  which reduced net income to a net loss The net loss for the three months ended December 31 2017 was 2.9 million For the three months ended December 31 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of 2.6 million and net earnings of 1.6 million Diluted net loss per share decreased to 0.37 for the three months ended December 31 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of 0.21 for the three months ended December 31 2016 Revenue decreased 7 to 20.5 million for the three months ended December 31 2017 as compared to 22.0 million for the three months ended December 31 2016 The Company announced that its pretax income for the nine months ending December 31 2017 was 2.7 million In the month of December 2017 the
Company had a one-time income tax expense adjustment of 3.4 million relating to the TCJA which reduced net income to a net loss The net loss for the nine months ended December 31 2017 was 1.7 million For the nine months ended December 31 2016 the Company had pretax earnings of 10.5 million and net earnings of 6.5 million Diluted net loss per share decreased to 0.22 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 as compared to diluted earnings per share of 0.83 for the nine months ended December 31 2016 Revenue decreased 5 to 64.1 million for the nine months ended December 31 2017 as compared to 67.6 million for the nine months ended December 31 2016 On December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law TCJA  The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes
to tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1 2018 The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a
one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of 3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level
that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31 2017 17 Three months endedDecember 31 In thousands Nine months endedDecember 31 In thousands 2017 2016 2017 2016 Portfolio Summary Average finance receivables net of unearned interest 1 321,742 349,916 333,660 345,950 Average indebtedness 2 183,615 210,745 196,619 209,875 Interest and fee income on finance receivables 20,526 22,044 64,062 67,606 Interest expense 2,585 2,258 7,483 6,745 Net interest and fee income on finance receivables 17,941 19,786 56,579 60,861 Gross portfolio yield 3 25.52 25.20 25.60 26.06 Interest expense as a percentage of average finance receivables net of unearned interest 3.21 2.58 2.99 2.60 Provision for credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables net of unearned

decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average weighted APR of the portfolio and a decrease in the volume of Contracts purchased Average
finance receivables net of unearned interest equaled approximately 321.7 million for the three-month period ended December 31 2017 a decrease of 8 from 349.9 million for the corresponding period ended December 31 2016 Our
purchasing volume declined 39 quarter over quarter mainly as a result of the modification of our underwriting guidelines including the use of alternative data provided by a third party service company beginning in March 2017 to improve pricing
for proper risk The decrease in average finance receivables net of unearned interest was primarily due to this decrease in purchasing volume The gross
portfolio yield increased to 25.52 for the three-month period ended December 31 2017 compared to 25.20 for the three-month period ended December 31 2016 The gross portfolio yield increased primarily due to the decrease in past-due accounts see Note 4 Finance Receivables  for further discussion The net portfolio yield decreased to 11.13 for the three-month period ended
December 31 2017 from 12.57 for the corresponding period ended December 31 2016 The net portfolio yield decreased due to an increase in interest expense as described under Interest Expense  and an increase in the provision

Administrative Expenses Marketing salaries employee benefits depreciation and administrative expenses decreased to approximately 8.1 million for the three-month period ended December 31 2017 from approximately 8.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31 2016 The decrease was primarily related to a decrease in bonuses related to the
declining portfolio performance along with a decrease in administrative costs directly related to the volume of Contracts purchased Marketing salaries employee benefits depreciation and administrative expenses as a percentage of finance
receivables net of unearned interest increased to 10.12 for the three-month period ended December 31 2017 from 9.70 for the three-month period ended December 31 2016 Interest Expense Interest expense increased to
approximately 2.6 million for the three-month period ended December 31 2017 as compared to 2.3 million for the three-month period ended December 31 2016 This increase was primarily due to the increase in the pricing to 400

December 31 2016 This increase is primarily a result of an increase in the net charge-off rate to 10.13 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from 8.57 for the nine months ended
December 31 2016 for the reasons described below The Company s allowance for credit losses incorporates recent trends that include increased
delinquencies by analyzing the allowance on a loan by loan basis which the Company believes more closely depicts the amount of the allowance for credit losses needed to maintain an adequate reserve within a static pool The Company believes that
this approach reflects the current trends of incurred losses within the portfolio and better aligns the allowance for credit losses with the portfolio s performance indicators The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average net
receivables see note 7 in the Portfolio Summary table in the Introduction  above for the definition of allowance percentage increased to 6.59 for the three months ended December 31 2017 from 4.21 for the three months
ended December 31 2016 The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of average net receivables increased to 6.35 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from 4.26 for the nine months ended December 31 2016 The increase is
primarily a result of an increase in write-off to liquidation to 13.66 for the three months ended December 31 2017 from 12.35 for the three months ended December 31 2016 and to 13.00 for the
nine months ended December 31 2017 from 11.02 for the nine months ended December 31 2016 The Company considers multiple factors to assist
in determining appropriate loss reserve levels The Company continues to evaluate reserve levels on a pool-by-pool basis during each reporting period The longer-term
outlook for portfolio performance will depend on overall economic conditions the rational or irrational behavior of the Company s competitors and the Company s ability to monitor manage and implement its underwriting and collections
philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion The Company s loan losses as a percentage of liquidation see
note 5 in the Portfolio Summary table in the Introduction  above for the definition of write-off to liquidation increased to 13.66 for the three months ended December 31 2017 as
compared to 12.35 for the three months ended December 31 2016 The Company s losses as a percentage of liquidation increased to 13.00 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 as compared to 11.02 for the nine months ended
December 31 2016 The increases in the net charge-off percentage write-off to liquidation percentage and allowance percentage for both the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31 2017 were primarily the result of the Company underestimating the
competitiveness of the market in prior years and purchasing loans of lower credit quality in such years As these loans move toward maturity the actual losses do not occur evenly over their respective lives Within both the three-month and
nine-month periods ended December 31 2017 the Company saw more charge-offs in these lower quality pools than it saw for the same pools during the three-month and nine-month periods ended December 31 2016 At the beginning of 2016 the
Company implemented measures to mitigate losses identify fraud on the front end and more accurately price 22 for risk In January of 2016 the Company modified its underwriting policies in March of 2017 the Company engaged a third party service company to more accurately price risk and in June of
2017 the Company created a centralized funding department to provide a final review of all Contracts prior to funding The Company also continues to see decreased auction proceeds from repossessed vehicles which increases the amount of
write-offs which in turn increases the write-off to liquidation percentage allowance percentage and net charge-off percentage During the three months ended
December 31 2017 and 2016 auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 36 and 37 respectively of the related principal balance During the nine months ended December 31 2017 and 2016 auction
proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately 35 and 38 respectively of the related principal balance Based on current market conditions the Company does not expect auction proceeds to improve within the remaining
quarters of the fiscal year Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 4.10 and 6.88 for the three months ended December 31 2017 and 2016 respectively Recoveries as a percentage of charge-offs were approximately 5.26 and 7.49 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 and 2016 respectively The Company attributes a large portion of this decrease simply to the
increase in charge-offs for the 2017 periods and to a lesser extent to the September 1 2016 change in its accounting policy to write off accounts that are 180 delinquent from 120 days delinquent The Company periodically aggregates charge-off accounts it deems uncollectible and sells them to a third-party For the nine months ended December 31,2016 the Company received approximately 225k from a third party sale this has not occurred in
the nine-months ended December 31 2017 The delinquency percentage for Contracts more than thirty days past due excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy
accounts as of December 31 2017 was 13.76 a decrease from 14.45 as of December 31 2016 The delinquency percentage for Direct Loans more than thirty days past due excluding Chapter 13 bankruptcy accounts as of December 31 2017 was 4.46 a decrease from 4.88 as of December 31 2016 The decrease in delinquency percentage for both Contracts and Direct Loans was driven primarily by portfolio improvement The delinquency percentage for the period ended
December 31 2016 was exacerbated by greater than anticipated difficulties in implementing a centralized collection model in October 2016 after the Company moved all loan-servicing operations from branch locations to a centralized location
within its corporate headquarters in Clearwater The Company has since moved all of its collections back to the branches The Company has continued to
see a significant number of competitors with aggressive underwriting in its operating market See Note 4 Finance Receivables  for changes in allowance for credit losses credit quality and delinquencies In accordance with our policies and procedures certain borrowers qualify for and the Company offers one-month
principal payment deferrals on Contracts and Direct Loans For the three months ended December 31 2017 and December 31 2016 the Company granted deferrals to approximately 7.47 and 11.84 respectively of total Contracts and Direct
Loans For the nine months ended December 31 2017 and December 31 2016 the Company granted deferrals to approximately 30.34 and 22.85 respectively of total Contracts and Direct Loans The increase in the number of deferrals for the
nine month period ended December 31 2017 was mainly a result of the impact of Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Harvey with 42 of our branch locations located in areas that were affected by these storms The Company offered deferrals to those
customers that were impacted to assist them during a time of crisis Additionally deferments are influenced by portfolio performance including but not limited to inflation credit quality of loans purchased competition at the time of Contract
acquisition and general economic conditions Income Taxes On December 22 2017 the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed into law TCJA  The TCJA includes a broad range of tax reform including changes to
tax rates and deductions that are effective January 1 2018 The decrease in the enacted corporate tax rate expected to apply when our temporary differences are realized or settled ultimately resulted in a
one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax asset of 3.4 million in December 2017 with a corresponding charge to income tax expense The tax effects of the TCJA increased income tax expense to a level
that reduced net income to a net loss for both the three and nine-month periods ending December 31 2017 The provision for income taxes increased
to approximately 3.7 million for the three months ended December 31 2017 from approximately 1.0 million for the three months ended December 31 2016 The Company s effective tax rate increased to 456.48 for the three
months ended December 31 2017 from 37.93 for the three months ended December 31 2016 The provision for income taxes increased to approximately 4.4 million for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from approximately 4.0 million for the nine months ended December 31 2016 The Company s effective tax rate increased to 164.70 for the nine months ended December 31 2017 from 38.01 for the nine months ended December 31 2016 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s cash flows are summarized as follows Nine months endedDecember 31 In thousands 2017 2016 Cash provided by used in Operating activities 18,551 22,518 Investing activities 16,214 24,232 Financing activities 34,538 3,529 Net increase in cash 227 1,815 The Company s primary use of working capital for the nine months ended December 31 2017 was funding the purchase of
Contracts which are financed substantially through cash from principal payments received cash from operations and our line of credit the Line  The Company may borrow up to 225.0 million under the Line Effective
November 8 2017 the Company executed amendment 7 to the Line which extended the maturity date to March 31 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1 floor on LIBOR The
amendment also increased the voting stock ownership limit from 20 to 30 and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending
December 31 2017 On December 30 2016 the Company had executed an amendment which increased the pricing of the Line to 350 basis points
above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1 floor on LIBOR This pricing was maintained under a subsequent amendment effective June 30 2017 Prior to December 30 2016 the pricing on the Line was 300 basis points above 30 day LIBOR with
a 1 floor on LIBOR Pledged as collateral for this Line are all the assets of the Company The Line requires compliance with certain financial
ratios and covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests As of December 31 2017 the Company is in compliance with all debt covenants Had the Company not entered into
amendment 6 and amendment 7 to the credit agreement the Company would not have been in compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.5:1 as of June 30 2017 September 30 2017 and December 31 2017 respectively As of December 31 2017 the amount outstanding under the Line was 178.0 million while the average amount outstanding during the three and nine
months ended December 31 2017 was 183.6 million and 196.6 million respectively The exact amount that the Company may borrow under the Line at any given time is determined in accordance with the Second Amended and Restated Loan
and Security Agreement as subsequently amended The Company will continue to depend on the availability of the Line together with cash from operations to finance future operations The availability of funds under the Line generally depends on availability calculations as defined in the corresponding credit agreement In addition our credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial
ratios and covenants and to satisfy specified financial tests including maintenance of asset quality and portfolio performance tests Since the
borrowings available under the Line are calculated every month based on individual loan criteria as defined in the credit agreement no assurances can be given that the Company will maintain sufficient availability As disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements the quality of the Company s loan portfolio has generally been deteriorating which has resulted in
an increase in non-performing loans an increase in delinquencies with a decrease limited to the quarter ended December 31 2017 and other factors which in turn has resulted in increased net
charge-offs and an increase in the provision for credit losses These conditions have resulted in a reduction in net earnings and have affected our borrowing capacity under the credit facility Failure to meet any financial ratios covenants or financial tests could result in an event of default under our line of credit facility If an event of
default occurs under the credit facility our lenders could increase our borrowing costs restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the facility accelerate all amounts outstanding under the facility or enforce their interest
against collateral pledged under the facility The Company has a longstanding relationship with its lenders and believes it is probable that it will be
able to obtain financing from either its existing lenders or from other sources However the Line currently matures on March 31,2018 The Company can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the
Line past its current maturity or assuming that they will approve it that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing including but not limited to the issuance of equity or debt however we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 24 See also Our business depends on our continued access to bank financing on acceptable terms  in 1A Risk Factors  in this report which is incorporated herein by reference Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the Company s material obligations as of December 31 2017 Payments Due by Period(In thousands Total Less than1 year 1 to 3years 3 to 5years More than5 years Operating leases 4,153 2,505 1,578 70 Line of credit1 178,000 178,000 Interest on Line1 2,479 2,479 Total 184,632 182,984 1,578 70 1 The Company s Line matures on March 31 2018 Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Line as of December 31 2017 is based on an effective interest rate of 5.57 The effective interest rate used
in the above table does not contemplate the possibility of entering into interest rate swap agreements in the future ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Market risks relating to the Company s operations result primarily
from changes in interest rates The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes Interest rate risk Management s objective is
to minimize the cost of borrowing through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt Derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap agreements may be used to managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from
ongoing business operations The Company does not use interest rate swap agreements for speculative purposes and does not currently have any active agreements As of December 31 2017 178.0 million or 100.00 of our total debt was subject to floating interest rates As a result a hypothetical increase
in LIBOR of 1 or 100 basis points based on actual LIBOR rates of 1.57 as of December 31 2017 would have resulted in an annual after-tax increase of interest expense of approximately 1.2 million ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures In accordance with Rule 13a-15(b of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 the Exchange Act  as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the Company s management evaluated with the participation of the Company s
President and Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e under the Exchange Act Based
upon their evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Changes in internal control over financial reporting There have been
no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control
over financial reporting 25 PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS The Company currently is not a party to any pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business none of which if
decided adversely to the Company would in the opinion of management have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS In
addition to the risk factors below and the other information set forth in this report you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors  in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31 2017 which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results The risks described below elsewhere in this report and in the Form 10-K are not the only risks facing the Company Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our
business financial condition and/or operating results Our business depends on our continued access to bank financing on acceptable terms Our business is particularly dependent on our ability to access bank financing at competitive rates We currently use a 225.0 million line of credit
facility the Line  with a consortium of lenders to finance a large portion of our Contract purchases and Direct Loans This Line has a maturity date of March 31 2018 Effective November 8 2017 the
Company executed amendment 7 to the Line which extended the maturity date to March 31 2018 and increased the pricing of the Line to 400 basis points above 30 day LIBOR while maintaining the 1 floor on LIBOR The amendment also increased the
voting stock ownership limit from 20 to 30 and revised the calculation of availability and the minimum interest coverage ratio The threshold for the minimum interest coverage ratio was lowered for the period ending December 31 2017 We can provide no assurances that the lenders will approve the further renewal or extension of the Line past March 31 2018 or assuming that they will
approve it that the facility will not be on terms less favorable than the current agreement If the Company is unable to renew or replace the facility or find alternative financing or to do so on acceptable terms it will be unable to finance the
same or similar level of Contract purchases or Direct Loans and will likely be required to curtail portions of its strategic plan This in turn would have a material adverse effect on its liquidity capital resources and results of operations Pledged as collateral for the Line are substantially all of the assets of the Company The Line requires compliance with certain financial ratios and
covenants and satisfaction of specified financial tests including maintenance of asset quality and performance tests Had the Company not entered into amendment 6 and amendment 7 to the credit agreement the Company would not have been in
compliance with the minimum interest coverage ratio of 1.5:1 as of June 30 2017 September 30 2017 and December 31 2017 respectively Failure to meet any financial ratios covenants or financial tests could result in an event of
default under the Line If an event of default occurs our lenders could increase our borrowing costs restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under the facility accelerate all amounts outstanding under the facility or enforce their
interest against collateral pledged under the facility Since the borrowings available under the Line are calculated every month based on individual loan
criteria as defined in the credit agreement no assurances can be given that the Company will maintain sufficient availability As disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements the quality of the Company s loan portfolio has generally been
deteriorating which has resulted in an increase in non-performing loans an increase in delinquencies with a decrease limited to the quarter ended December 31 2017 and other factors which in turn has
resulted in increased net charge-offs and an increase in the provision for credit losses These conditions have resulted in a reduction in net earnings and have affected our borrowing capacity under the Line The Company may also determine to seek alternative financing including but not limited through the issuance of equity or debt We may not be able to raise
additional funds on acceptable terms or at all If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operating activities we may be required to curtail portions of our strategic plan Any equity financings may cause substantial dilution
to our stockholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the common stock Any allowed debt financings may require us to comply with onerous financial covenants and restrict our business operations Our ability to
complete additional financings is dependent on among other things the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed offering market reception of the Company and the likelihood of the success of our business model and the offering
terms among other things 26 Changes in U.S federal state and local tax law or interpretations of existing tax law could increase our tax
burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations We are subject to taxation at the federal state and local
levels in the United States On December 22 2017 the U.S government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the TCJA  The changes included in the TCJA are broad and complex The
final transition impacts of the TCJA may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this report possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the TCJA any legislative action to address questions that arise
because of the TCJA any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the TCJA or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts including impacts from
changes to current year earnings estimates The estimated impact of the new law is based on management s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based on our actual results
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and our further analysis of the new law 27 Item 6 EXHIBITS Exhibit
