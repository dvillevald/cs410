influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The Allstate Corporation referred to in this document as we our us the Company  or Allstate  It should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto found under Part I Item 1 contained herein and with the discussion analysis consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part I Item 1 and Part II Item 7 and Item 8 of The Allstate Corporation annual report on Form 10-K for 2017 Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in the Property-Liability Operations and Segment Results sections including Allstate Protection Service Businesses Allstate Life Allstate Benefits and Allstate Annuities of Management s Discussion and Analysis MD&A  The segments are consistent with the way in which the chief operating decision maker reviews financial performance and makes decisions about the allocation of resources Measuring segment profit or lossThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and adjusted net income for the Service Businesses Allstate Life Allstate Benefits Allstate Annuities and Corporate and Other segments Underwriting income is calculated as premiums earned and other revenue less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP  We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results Underwriting income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders in the Property-Liability Operations section of Management s Discussion and Analysis.Adjusted net income is net income applicable to common shareholders excluding Realized capital gains and losses after-tax except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in adjusted net income  Valuation changes on embedded derivatives not hedged after-tax  Amortization of DAC and deferred sales inducement costs DSI  to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded derivatives not hedged after-tax  Business combination expenses and the amortization of purchased intangible assets after-tax  Gain loss on disposition of operations after-tax  Adjustments for other significant non-recurring infrequent or unusual items when a the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years or b there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two yearsAdjusted net income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders in the Service Businesses Allstate Life Allstate Benefits and Allstate Annuities Segment sections of MD&A.46 www.allstate.comHighlightsConsolidated Net Income in millions Consolidated net income applicable to common shareholders increased 30.8 and 30.4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively compared to the prior periods The increase in both periods was driven by a 5.8 and 3.4 increase in total revenue see table below lower catastrophe losses and a lower effective tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 partially offset by higher property and casualty insurance non-catastrophe claims losses higher amortization of DAC for property and casualty businesses and Allstate Life and lower realized capital gains in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017.The Property-Liability combined ratio increased from 93.9 in the third quarter of 2017 to 94.3 in the third quarter of 2018 and improved from 94.5 in the first nine months of 2017 to 92.5 in the first nine months of 2018.Total Revenue in millions)Total revenue increased 5.8 and 3.4 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively compared to the prior periods driven by a 5.7 and 5.0 increase in insurance premiums in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively Insurance premiums increased in the following segments Allstate Protection Allstate brand and Esurance Service Businesses Allstate Benefits and Allstate Life The increase in revenue in the first nine months of 2018 is partially offset by lower net realized capital gains and net investment income.Net Investment Income in millions)Net investment income was flat in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the third quarter of 2017 Net investment income decreased 1.4 in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to lower performance-based investment results mainly from limited partnerships LegendThird Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 47Segment HighlightsAllstate Protection underwriting income totaled 553 million in the third quarter of 2018 a 3.3 decrease from 572 million in the third quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher claim severity higher operating costs and expenses and lower favorable non-catastrophe prior year reserve reestimates partially offset by increased premiums earned lower catastrophe losses and improved auto claim frequency Underwriting income totaled 1.93 billion in the first nine months of 2018 a 38.9 increase from 1.39 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to increased premiums earned lower catastrophe losses and improved auto claim frequency partially offset by higher claim severity and operating costs and expenses Premiums written increased 5.9 to 8.80 billion in the third quarter of 2018 and 5.8 to 25.19 billion in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 Service Businesses adjusted net income was zero in the third quarter of 2018 compared to an adjusted net loss of 17 million in the third quarter of 2017 Adjusted net loss improved to 4 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 35 million in the first nine months of 2017 The improvements in both periods were primarily due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade and Allstate Dealer Services partially offset by higher loss costs and investments in the provider network and technology at Allstate Roadside Services and investments in business expansion at Arity Total revenues increased 21.0 to 329 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 23.5 to 962 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 These amounts include 24 million and 80 million related to SquareTrade in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively recorded for protection plans sold directly to retailers prior to January 1 2018 for which SquareTrade is deemed to be the principal These amounts are due to the adoption of the revenue from contracts with customers accounting standard and are offset by corresponding increases in amortization of DAC resulting in no impact to adjusted net income Net investment income increased 3 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 7 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 Allstate Life adjusted net income was 74 million in both the third quarter of 2018 and 2017 Adjusted net income was 221 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 196 million in the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to a lower effective tax rate from the Tax Legislation increased premiums and higher net investment income partially offset by higher contract benefits Premiums and contract charges increased 1.9 to 322 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 2.0 to 975 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017.Allstate Benefits adjusted net income was 32 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 28 million in the third quarter of 2017 and 94 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 75 million in the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to higher premiums and a lower effective tax rate from the Tax Legislation partially offset by higher contract benefits and operating costs and expenses.Premiums and contract charges increased 4.4 to 285 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 5.3 to 854 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017.Allstate Annuities adjusted net income was 20 million in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 55 million in the third quarter of 2017 and 99 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to 149 million in the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to decreased net investment income driven by lower performance-based investment results and average investment balances partially offset by a lower effective tax rate from the Tax Legislation and decreased interest credited to contractholder funds.Net investment income decreased 19.8 to 260 million in the third quarter of 2018 and 12.8 to 843 million in the first nine months of 2018 compared to the same periods of 2017 48 www.allstate.comFinancial HighlightsTax reform On December 22 2017 Public Law 115-97 known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Tax Legislation  became effective permanently reducing the U.S corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning January 1 2018 As a result the corporate tax rate is not comparable between periods During 2017 we revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded liabilities related to the transition to the modified territorial system for international taxation During the third quarter of 2018 the impact of the Tax Legislation was adjusted from our preliminary estimate due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we previously made guidance that was issued and actions we took as a result of the Tax Legislation During the third quarter of 2018 we recorded a reduction of 31 million to income tax expense related to these provisional amounts We may make adjustments to these provisional amounts as additional information becomes available and future guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service.We are utilizing a portion of the benefits from the Tax Legislation for the following initiatives Accelerating growth initiatives Enhancing our employee value proposition Improving local communities Increasing cash returns to shareholders through the increase of our quarterly dividend per common share in the first quarter of 2018In the first quarter of 2018 employees received either 1,000 or 2,000 of Choice Dollars Choice Dollars  following a reduction in the federal tax rate which could be taken as a cash bonus or contributed to a 401(k or health savings account 43 million was recorded as an expense with 21 million recorded in claims and claim expense and 22 million recorded in other costs and expenses The expenses associated with these initiatives will occur throughout 2018 and will reoccur in future periods.InfoArmor On October 5 2018 we acquired InfoArmor Inc InfoArmor  a leading provider of identity protection in the employee benefits market for 525 million in cash InfoArmor primarily offers identity protection to employees and their family members through voluntary benefit programs at over 1,400 firms including more than 100 of the Fortune 500 companies Investments totaled 83.97 billion as of September 30 2018 increasing from 82.80 billion as of December 31 2017.Shareholders  equity As of September 30 2018 shareholders  equity was 23.63 billion including 3.38 billion in deployable assets at the parent holding company level comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter.Book value per diluted common share ratio of common shareholders  equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares outstanding was 60.79 as of September 30 2018 an increase of 9.2 from 55.69 as of September 30 2017 and an increase of 5.6 from 57.58 as of December 31 2017.Return on average common shareholders  equity For the twelve months ended September 30 2018 net income applicable to common shareholders  return on the average of beginning and ending period common shareholders  equity of 17.4 increased by 3.9 points from 13.5 for the twelve months ended September 30 2017 Pension settlement loss During the third quarter of 2018 we concluded that our qualified employee pension plan 2018 lump sum payments are expected to exceed a threshold of service and interest cost which resulted in a pension settlement loss of 61 million pre-tax and was recorded as part of operating costs and expenses in the Corporate and Other segment We will continue to monitor lump sum payments through the end of the year and we expect to recognize an additional settlement loss based on lump sum payments made during the fourth quarter of 2018 During third quarter 2017 we also recorded a pension settlement loss in the amount of 86 million pre-tax related to higher levels of lump sum payments in the qualified employee pension plan.Common share repurchases On October 31 2018 the Board authorized a new 3.00 billion common share repurchase program that is expected to be completed by April 2020 Adopted Accounting Standards Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities recognition and measurement accounting standard  Beginning January 1 2018 equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in realized capital gains and losses Limited partnerships previously reported using the cost method are now reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net investment income See the Investments section of this Item for further details.Revenue from Contracts with Customers Beginning January 1 2018 we adopted the revenue from contracts with customers accounting standard which revises the criteria for revenue recognition and impacted the Service Businesses segment by increasing deferred revenue by approximately 160 million with a corresponding increase in DAC for protection plans that are sold directly to retailers The anticipated impact of these adjustments offset and do not impact net income but impact premium and DAC comparability trends as they are recognized over the life of the policy.See Note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the adopted accounting standards.Third Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 49Consolidated net income Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended September 30 in millions 2018 2017 2018 2017Revenues Property-liability insurance

Our Property-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.We do not allocate Property-Liability investment income realized capital gains and losses or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the ratio of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the ratio of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined ratio the ratio of amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned Amortization of purchased intangible assets is reported in operating costs and expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the ratio of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.Third Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 51Property-Liability OperationsSummarized financial data Three months ended September 30 Nine months ended

billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 respectively We define a catastrophe  as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of 1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area occurring within a certain amount of time following the event Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds winter storms and freezes tornadoes hailstorms wildfires tropical storms tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.Loss estimates are generally based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors Our loss estimates are calculated in accordance with the coverage provided by our policies Auto policyholders generally have coverage for physical damage due to flood if they have purchased optional auto comprehensive coverage Our homeowners policies specifically exclude coverage for losses caused by flood Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high

respectively compared to the same periods of 2017 primarily due to increased premiums earned lower catastrophe losses and improved claim frequency partially offset by higher claim severity Frequency and severity statistics which are influenced by driving patterns inflation and other factors are provided to describe the trends in loss costs of the business Our reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns operational statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to determine our best estimate of recorded reserves We use the following statistics to evaluate losses Paid claim frequency 1 is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of PIF with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency 1 is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of PIF with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed with a payment or closed without payment Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period Percent change in frequency or severity statistics is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency or severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency or severity 1 Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events.Third Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 65Segment Results Allstate Protection Allstate brandPaid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect smaller differences as timing between opening and settlement is generally less For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity We are continuing to aggressively seek new technology and process solutions to provide continued loss cost accuracy efficient processing and enhanced customer experiences that are simple fast and produce high degrees of satisfaction For example we have opened several Digital Operating Centers to handle auto claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation capabilities which includes estimating damage through photos and video with the use of QuickFoto Claim  and Virtual AssistSM These organizational and process changes impact frequency and severity statistics as changes in claim opening and closing practices and shifts in timing if any can impact comparisons to prior periods Property damage paid claim frequency increased 0.2 and decreased 2.0 in the third quarter and first

first nine months of 2018 respectively compared to the same periods of 2017 due to the impact of higher costs to repair more sophisticated newer model vehicles higher third-party subrogation demands and increased costs associated with total losses Bodily injury gross claim frequency decreased 0.7 and 1.8 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 respectively compared to the same periods

while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-based core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-based active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk primarily through investments in private equity and real estate.88 www.allstate.comInvestments Portfolio composition by investment strategy As of September 30 2018 in millions Market-based core Market-based active

subordinated debentures are viewed as having a common equity component by certain rating agencies and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined limit in our capital structure as determined by their respective methodologies These respective methodologies consider the existence of certain terms and features in the instruments such as the noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock

and enterprise level across the Company and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs We believe we Third Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 95Capital Resources and Liquidityhave sufficient liquidity to meet these needs Additionally we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility.The Allstate Corporation is party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement Liquidity Agreement  with certain subsidiaries which include but are not limited to ALIC and AIC The Liquidity Agreement allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party ALIC and AIC each serve as a lender and borrower certain other subsidiaries serve only as borrowers and the Corporation serves only as a lender AIC also has a capital support agreement with ALIC Under the capital support agreement AIC is committed to providing capital to ALIC to maintain an adequate capital level The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is 1.00 billion.In addition to the Liquidity Agreement the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries which include but are not limited to AIC and ALIC The amount of

subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to 1.00 billion The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings.Parent company capital capacity At the parent holding company level we have deployable assets totaling 3.38 billion as of September 30 2018 comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter The substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation and provides funds for the parent company s fixed charges and other corporate purposes.In the first nine months of 2018 AIC paid dividends totaling 2.27 billion to its parent Allstate Insurance Holdings LLC which then paid 2.27 billion of dividends to the Corporation Dividends may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for We are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy net income or shareholders  equity levels except out of the net proceeds of common stock issued during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration As of September 30 2018 we satisfied all of the tests with no current restrictions on the payment of preferred stock dividends The terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming purchasing acquiring or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures subject to certain limited exceptions In the first nine months of 2018 we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.Additional resources to support liquidity are as follows The Corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of 1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs As of September 30 2018 there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was 1.00 billion however the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily The Corporation AIC and ALIC have access to a 1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements The maturity date of this facility is April 2021 The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being 115 million The commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional 500 million of borrowing This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5 debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement This ratio was 15.0 as of September 30 2018 Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured unguaranteed long-term debt There were no borrowings under the credit facility during the third quarter or the first nine months of 2018 The Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30 2018 We can use this shelf

insurance coverage needs Other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge the length of time the contract has been in force distribution channel market interest rates equity market conditions and potential tax implications In addition the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products based on the beginning of year contractholder funds was 7.1 and 6.0 in the first nine months of 2018 and 2017 respectively We strive to promptly pay customers who request cash
