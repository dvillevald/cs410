foreseeable future In addition price commodity natural gas makes smaller portion cost gasoline gallon equivalent GGE CNG relative commodity portion cost gallon diesel gasoline price CNG less sensitive increases underlying commodity cost.Cleaner Natural gas contains less carbon fossil fuel thus produces fewer carbon dioxide emissions burned The California Air Resources Board CARB concluded CNG fueled vehicle emits 20 29 percent fewer greenhouse gas GHG emissions comparable gasoline diesel-fueled vehicle well-to-wheel basis Additionally study Argonne National Laboratory research laboratory operated University Chicago U.S Department Energy indicates natural gas vehicles produce least 13 21 percent fewer GHG emissions comparable gasoline diesel-fueled vehicles In addition ANG working towards supplying stations renewable natural gas RNG offers 115 fewer greenhouse gases diesel.Safer As reported NGV America CNG relatively safer gasoline diesel dissipates air spilled event vehicle accident When released CNG less combustible gasoline diesel ignites relatively high temperatures The fuel tanks systems used natural gas vehicles subjected number federally required safety tests fire environmental hazard burst pressures crash testing according U.S Department Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration In addition CNG stored ground tanks thus reducing risk soil
