OPERATIONSCore Laboratories N.V Netherlands limited liability company We established 1936 one world's leading providers proprietary patented reservoir description production enhancement services products oil gas industry primarily client relationships many world's major national independent oil companies.In first quarter 2017 Core Laboratories took steps streamline business realigning reporting structure two reporting segments These complementary segments provide different services products utilize different technologies improving reservoir performance increasing oil gas recovery new existing fields In connection realignment reporting structure amounts previously reported Reservoir Management segment presented within Reservoir Description Production Enhancement segments prior periods revised conform current presentation Reservoir Description Encompasses characterization petroleum reservoir rock fluid gas samples increase production improve recovery oil gas clients reservoirs We provide laboratory-based analytical field services characterize properties crude oil petroleum products oil gas industry We also provide proprietary joint industry studies based types analyses Production Enhancement Includes services products relating reservoir well completions perforations stimulations production We provide integrated diagnostic services evaluate monitor effectiveness well completions develop solutions aimed increasing effectiveness enhanced oil recovery projects.General OverviewWe provide services design produce products enable clients evaluate reservoir performance increase oil gas recovery new existing fields These services products generally higher demand clients investing capital field development programs designed increase productivity existing fields exploring new fields Our clients investment capital expenditure programs tends correlate longer term oil natural gas commodity prices During periods higher stable prices clients generally invest capital expenditures periods lower volatile commodity prices tend invest less Consequently level capital expenditures clients impacts demand services products.The following table
