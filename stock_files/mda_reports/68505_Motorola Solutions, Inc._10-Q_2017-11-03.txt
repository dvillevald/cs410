recognition guidance U.S GAAP The core principle ASU recognition revenue transfer goods services equal amount entity expects receive goods services This ASU requires additional disclosures nature amount timing uncertainty revenue cash flows arising customer contracts including significant judgments estimates changes estimates In August 2015 FASB issued ASU No 2015-14 Revenue Contracts Customers Deferral Effective Date delayed effective date ASU No 2014-09 one year January 1 2018 annual reporting period begins December 15 2017.We continued analyze impact new standard financial results based inventory current contracts customers We obtained understanding new standard currently believe retain much accounting treatment used recognize revenue current standards Revenue significant portion contracts currently recognized percentage completion accounting applying cost-to-cost method including contracts radio network deployments based ASTRO P25 TETRA LTE technologies well certain offerings within Smart Public Safety Solutions requiring significant integration collectively network integration contracts Under new standard must identify distinct promises transfer goods and/or services within contracts using certain factors For network integration contracts considered factors used determine whether promises made contract distinct determined devices accessories represent distinct goods Accordingly adoption new standard impact network integration contracts include devices accessories resulting impact revenue recognized earlier control devices accessories transfers customer point time rather 33time For remaining promised goods services within network integration contracts continue recognize revenue contracts using cost-to-cost method based continuous transfer control customer time Transfer control contracts demonstrated creating customized asset customers conjunction contract terms provide right receive payment goods services.In addition standard may generally cause issuers accelerate revenue recognition contracts previously limited software revenue recognition rules While contracts fall rules current standard historically deferred significant amounts revenue rules many arrangements single-element software arrangements sales software tangible product falls scope current software rules Based contracts currently place anticipate significant acceleration revenue upon applying new standard current contracts fact patterns The new standard also requires concept transfer control determine whether entity must present revenue providing goods services gross amount billed customer principal net amount retained agent Therefore entity must assess whether controls goods services provided customer transferred The new standard provides three indicators assist entities determining control Under current standard eight indicators including three indicators new standard exist evaluate whether entity present revenue gross principal net agent Historically presented transactions involved third-party sales representative net basis After considering control concept remaining three indicators new standard determined principal contracts involve
