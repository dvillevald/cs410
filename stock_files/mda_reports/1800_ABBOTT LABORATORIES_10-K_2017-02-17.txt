customers As Established Pharmaceuticals actively pursue primary research development usually begins work existing products acquisition advanced stage licensing opportunity Depending upon product phases development may include Drug product development 39 Phase I bioequivalence studies compare future Established Pharmaceutical's brand already marketed compound active pharmaceutical ingredient API Phase II studies test efficacy benefits small group patients Phase III studies broaden testing wider population reflects actual medical use Phase IV post-marketing studies obtain new clinical use data existing products within approved indications The specific requirements e.g scope clinical trials obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries geographic regions The process may range one year bioequivalence study project 6 years complex formulations new indications geographic expansion specific countries China In Diagnostics segment phases research development process include Discovery focuses identification product address specific therapeutic area platform unmet clinical need Concept/Feasibility materials manufacturing processes evaluated testing may include product characterization analysis performed confirm clinical utility Development extensive testing performed demonstrate product meets specified design requirements design specifications conform user needs intended uses The regulatory requirements diagnostic products vary across different countries geographic regions In U.S FDA classifies diagnostic products classes I II III classification determines regulatory process approval While Diagnostics segment products three classes vast majority products categorized Class I Class II Submission separate regulatory filing required Class I products Class II devices typically require pre-market notification FDA regulatory filing known 510(k submission Most Class III products subject FDA's Pre-Marketing Approval PMA requirements Other Class III products used screen blood require submission approval Biological License Application BLA In EU diagnostic products also categorized different categories regulatory process governed European InVitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive depends upon category Certain product categories require review approval independent company known Notified Body manufacturer affix CE mark product show
