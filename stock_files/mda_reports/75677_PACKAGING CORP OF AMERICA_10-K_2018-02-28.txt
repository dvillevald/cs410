overall financial performance well company reporting unit specific items If assessing qualitative factors Company determines likely carrying value reporting unit less fair value testing required Otherwise Company would perform quantitative analysis The quantitative analysis requires companies compare fair value reporting units goodwill assigned respective carrying values In calculating fair value use income approach primary indicator fair value Under income approach calculate fair value reporting unit based present value estimated future cash flows These estimates based number factors including industry experience business expectations economic environment If fair value exceeds carrying value work required impairment loss recognized If carrying value exceeds fair value goodwill reporting unit potentially impaired carrying value goodwill reduced implied value zero fair value assets exceeds fair value reporting unit impairment charge During annual goodwill impairment test performed fourth quarter 2017 assessed qualitative factors determine whether likely fair value reporting unit less carrying value Based results qualitative impairment test determined likely carrying value less fair value Packaging Paper reporting units If management's estimates future operating results materially change changes assumptions estimated fair value goodwill could change significantly Such change could result impairment charges future periods could significant noncash impact operating results financial condition We cannot predict occurrence future events might adversely affect
