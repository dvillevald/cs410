## Team Members

- Venkat Rao Bhamidipathi (vrb3)
- Wang Chun Wei (wcwei2)

## Proposal

We have decided to focus on 'a review of emerging new applications of text retrieval or analysis' for our Technology Review.

Since our project proposal involves the analysis of sentiment in SEC filings, we believe there is compelling synergy to examine 'New Sentiment Analysis Tools for Financial Applications'.

We wish to survey and compare multiple toolkits / applications / methodologies that exist for sentiment analysis on financial data.

We propose to add some tutorials for readers to step through the various toolkits used to implement the new applications.
