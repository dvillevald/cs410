by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then those amounts are multiplied or divided as appropriate by the prior year average foreign exchange rates Net sales growth in 2018 was driven by the acquisition of Alere which closed in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as growth in all of Abbott s other businesses excluding the impact of foreign exchange The decrease in the Other category reflects the sale of the Abbott Medical Optics AMO business to Johnson  Johnson partially offset by growth in Abbott s Diabetes Care business The AMO business was included in Abbott s results as a non-reportable segment through February 27 2017 the date of the divestiture Double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was led by FreeStyle Libre Abbott s sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring CGM system which removes the need for routine fingersticks for people with diabetes Excluding the impact of the Alere acquisition the divestitures of AMO and the legacy St Jude Medical vascular closure business and the impact of foreign exchange total net sales increased 6.9 percent Sales related to these divestitures totaled 187 million in the first quarter of 2017 Abbott s net sales were also positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period The relatively weaker U.S dollar increased total international sales by 6.5 percent and total sales by 4.1 percent

the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott s branded generics product portfolio Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 6.8 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to double-digit growth across several geographies including India China and Brazil Excluding the effect of foreign exchange the 6.3 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales was primarily driven by strong growth across several countries in Asia including Greater China In the U.S the 3.7 percent increase in Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects market share gains in the infant nutrition category Excluding the effect of foreign exchange the 4.4 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales reflects continued strong growth of Ensure  and Glucerna  in Latin America and various other markets In the U.S the 4.0 percent increase in Adult Nutritional sales was driven by the growth of Ensure  in the retail and institutional market segments Excluding the effect of foreign exchange the 53.8 percent increase in Diagnostics sales was primarily driven by Alere which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 Excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in Diagnostics increased 5.5 percent driven by above-market growth and share gains in Core Laboratory in the U.S and internationally as well as growth in Point of Care s international sales Excluding the effect of foreign exchange the 5.6 percent increase in the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Neuromodulation The growth in Electrophysiology reflects share gains from the recent U.S launch of Abbott s Confirm RxTM Insertable Cardiac Monitor ICM the world s first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias The growth in Neuromodulation was led by recently launched products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders Growth in Structural Heart was driven by MitraClip  Abbott s market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation In March Abbott announced MitraClip was granted national reimbursement in Japan which enables greater access for patients to this therapy In Heart Failure sales growth was led by market uptake of Abbott s HeartMate 3 system In Vascular higher international drug eluting stent DES sales and growth in vessel closure and other revenues offset lower U.S DES sales due to lower market share In Rhythm Management market share gains in the new patient segment were offset by replacement cycle dynamics 22 Table of Contents The gross profit margin percentage was 50.6 percent for the first quarter 2018 compared to 43.4 percent for the first quarter 2017 The increase primarily reflects the favorable comparison versus the prior year which included inventory step-up amortization related to the St Jude Medical acquisition The increase also reflects margin improvement in various businesses including Diabetes Care and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Research and development expenses increased by 36 million or 6.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to the addition of the acquired Alere business as well as higher spending in other areas including Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation For the three months ended March 31 2018 research and development expenditures totaled 246 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment 147 million for the Diagnostic Products segment 44 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment and 48 million for the Nutritional Products segment Selling general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased 4.2 percent due primarily to the addition of the acquired Alere business as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses In the first quarter of 2018 Abbott retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-07 Compensation Retirement Benefits Topic 715 Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit expense While service cost continues to be reported in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs the ASU requires all other components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost to be presented separately from service cost and outside any subtotal of income from operations As a result of the new accounting standard approximately 40 million of pension and other post retirement related income is now being reported in Other income expense net in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 Business Acquisitions On January 4 2017 Abbott completed the acquisition of St Jude Medical a global medical device manufacturer for approximately 23.6 billion including approximately 13.6 billion in cash and approximately 10 billion in Abbott common shares which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock based on Abbott s closing stock price on the acquisition date As part of the acquisition approximately 5.9 billion of St Jude Medical s debt was assumed repaid or refinanced by Abbott The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company s ongoing effort to develop a strong diverse portfolio of devices diagnostics nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market as well as in the neuromodulation market Under the terms of the agreement for each St Jude Medical common share St Jude Medical shareholders received 46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott common share At an Abbott stock price of 39.36 which reflects the closing price on January 4 2017 this represented a value of approximately 81 per St Jude Medical common share and total purchase consideration of 23.6 billion The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a 2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid In 2016 Abbott and St Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation Terumo for approximately 1.12 billion The sale included the St Jude Medical Angio-Seal  and Femoseal  vascular closure and Abbott s Vado  Steerable Sheath businesses The sale closed on January 20 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings On October 3 2017 Abbott acquired Alere Inc Alere a diagnostic device and service provider for 51.00 per common share in cash which equated to a purchase price of approximately 4.5 billion As part of the acquisition Abbott tendered for Alere s preferred shares for a total value of approximately 0.7 billion In addition approximately 3.0 billion of Alere s debt was assumed and subsequently repaid The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing expands Abbott s global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products channels and geographies Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition 23 Table of Contents The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the Alere acquisition is shown in the table below The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed and differences between the preliminary and final allocation could be material in billions Acquired intangible assets non-deductible 3.5 Goodwill non-deductible 4.1 Acquired net tangible assets 0.9 Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition 0.7 Net debt 2.6 Preferred stock 0.7 Total preliminary allocation of fair value 4.5 The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition The goodwill is identifiable to the Diagnostic Products reportable segment The acquired tangible assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately 430 million inventory of approximately 425 million other current assets of 206 million property and equipment of approximately 540 million and other long-term assets of 112 million The acquired tangible liabilities consist of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately 625 million and other non-current liabilities of approximately 160 million In the third quarter of 2017 Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation Quidel The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of 400 million payable at the close of the transaction 240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction and contingent consideration with a maximum value of 40 million In the third quarter of 2017 Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V Siemens to sell its subsidiary Epocal Inc for approximately 200 million payable at the close of the transaction Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott s agreement to acquire Alere The sale to Quidel closed on October 6 2017 and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31 2017 No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings On July 17 2017 Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere s Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of 402 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to but not including the settlement date of the tender offer This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including Abbott s acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer The tender offer expired on October 3 2017 All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the 400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends without interest Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017 Restructuring Plans The results for the first three months of 2018 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of St Jude Medical and Alere as well as costs related to other actions associated with the company s plans to streamline various operations Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately 33 million in the first three months of 2018 related to these initiatives Approximately 10 million is recorded in Cost of products sold approximately 8 million is recognized in Research and development and approximately 15 million is recognized in Selling general and administrative expense See Note 10 to the financial statements Restructuring Plans for additional information regarding these charges 24 Table of Contents Other Income Expense net Other income expense net decreased by 1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 due to a pre-tax gain of 1.151 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2017 from Abbott s completion of the sale of AMO to Johnson  Johnson Interest Expense Income net Interest expense income net decreased 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher interest income in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of higher rates of return on cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties In the first quarter of 2018 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately 65 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation Earnings from discontinued operations net of tax in the first quarter of 2018 reflect the recognition of 9 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by 16 million In the first quarter of 2017 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include 430 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business which was taxed at a discrete tax rate Earnings from discontinued operations net of tax in the first quarter of 2017 reflected the recognition of 33 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by 33 million Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott s income tax filings Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by 150 million to 300 million including cash adjustments within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters In the U.S Abbott s federal income tax returns through 2013 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2012 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA  was enacted in the U.S on December 22 2017 The TCJA reduces the U.S federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings In the fourth quarter of 2017 Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of 1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately 2.89 billion for the transition tax partially offset by a net benefit of approximately 1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a net benefit of approximately 10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA In the first quarter of 2018 Abbott recorded a 15 million adjustment to the provisional transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax This adjustment increases the estimate of net tax expense for the impact of TCJA to 1.475 billion Given the significant complexity of the TCJA Abbott will continue to evaluate and analyze the impact of this legislation The 1.475 billion estimate is provisional and is based on Abbott s latest analysis of the TCJA and may be materially adjusted in future periods due to among other things additional analysis performed by Abbott and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S Department of Treasury the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board Discontinued Operations On January 1 2013 Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc AbbVie which was formed to hold Abbott s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation as well as certain non-income related taxes attributable to AbbVie s business prior to the separation AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business Earnings from discontinued operations reflect the recognition of a net tax benefit of 9 million and 33 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 respectively as a result of the resolution of various tax positions primarily related to AbbVie s operations for years prior to the separation 25 Table of Contents Assets Held for Disposition As discussed in Note 8  Business Acquisitions in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere Inc Alere Abbott sold the Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation Quidel The legal transfer of certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses did not occur at the close of the sale to Quidel due to among other factors the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in various countries Under the terms of the sale agreement with Abbott Quidel is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets The assets presented as held for disposition in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31 2018 and December 31 2017 primarily relate to the businesses sold to

2017 The reduction of cash and cash equivalents from 9.4 billion at December 31 2017 to 3.9 billion at March 31 2018 primarily reflects repayment of debt and the payment of dividends partially offset by cash generated from operations in the quarter Working capital was 6.0 billion at March 31 2018 and 11.2 billion at December 31 2017 The 5.2 billion decrease in working capital in 2018 is primarily due to the reduction in Cash and cash equivalents as discussed above Net cash from operating activities for the first three months of 2018 totaled 1.108 billion an increase of 534 million over the prior year due primarily to higher segment operating earnings continued improvements in working capital management timing of pension contributions and lower acquisition-related expenses Other net in

2018 Abbott s long-term debt rating was BBB by Standard  Poor s Corporation and Baa2 by Moody s Investors Service Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating Abbott has readily available financial resources including lines of credit of 5.0 billion which expire in 2019 In September 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3.0 billion of Abbott s common shares from time to time The 2014 authorization was in addition to the 512 million unused portion of a previous program announced in June 2013 In the first three months of 2016 Abbott repurchased 10.4 million shares at a cost of 408 million under the program authorized in 2014 On April 27 2016 the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common

In February 2018 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Abbott is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities which makes changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Abbott is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Adoption requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented Abbott is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements Revenue Recognition Standard In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach method Under this method entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of 23 million which was recorded at January 1 2018 The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings See Note 2 to the financial statements New Accounting Standards for additional information regarding recently issued accounting standards Legislative Issues Abbott s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk
