 Condition and Results of Operations for the Three-Month and Six-Month Periods Ended June 30 2017 and 2016OverviewAllstate is focused on the following priorities better serve our customers achieve target economic returns on capital grow customer base proactively manage investments and build long-term growth platforms.The following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of The Allstate Corporation referred to in this document as we our us the Company  or Allstate  It should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto found under Part I Item 1 contained herein and with the discussion analysis consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in Part I Item 1 and Part II Item 7 and Item 8 of The Allstate Corporation Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2016 Further analysis of our insurance segments is provided in the Property-Liability Operations which includes the Allstate Protection and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and in the Allstate Financial Segment sections of Management s Discussion and Analysis MD&A  The segments are consistent with the way in which we use financial information to evaluate business performance and to determine the allocation of resources Resources are allocated by the chief operating decision maker and performance is assessed for Allstate Protection Discontinued Lines and Coverages and Allstate Financial Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial performance and resources are managed by committees of senior officers of the respective segments Allstate Protection segment also includes SquareTrade and Arity With the objective of aligning our key product and service offerings including the acquisition of SquareTrade and the strategic focus and expansion of Arity and other emerging businesses management continuously evaluates its oversight structure and resource allocation processes As a result we are planning to adopt a new segment reporting structure in fourth quarter 2017 that would provide enhanced transparency and allow for an evaluation of our businesses grouped by attributes including traditional property and casualty protection services businesses life insurance voluntary benefits products and the annuity business The chief operating decision maker will receive financial results organized by the new segments in connection with reporting changes and the evaluation of our 2018 operating plan.Goodwill is required to be evaluated upon the change to our new reporting structure including the allocation to any new goodwill reporting units using a relative fair value approach We expect to allocate the 1.09 billion of goodwill recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of SquareTrade to our services businesses segment along with an immaterial amount of goodwill from the Allstate Protection segment related to other business areas that will be transferred into this segment Allstate Financial has 396 million of goodwill that would be reallocated between the new life insurance voluntary benefits and annuities segments While substantially all of the Allstate Financial goodwill relates to the acquisition of Allstate Benefits we would be required to allocate a portion of the goodwill to the new life insurance and annuities segments Goodwill will be tested for impairment in conjunction with the segment changes during the fourth quarter and will continue to be tested for impairment at least annually thereafter.We currently evaluate reserve adequacy on an aggregate basis for traditional life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies We also evaluate these policies on an aggregate basis for circumstances where projected profits would be recognized in early years followed by projected losses in later years As of December 31 2016 both traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies had projected profit however the aggregate sufficiency substantially relates to traditional life insurance We record an adjustment to the reserve for life-contingent contract benefits if applicable that represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product investment portfolios were realized and reinvested at current lower interest rates resulting in a premium deficiency The offset to this liability is recorded as a reduction of the unrealized net capital gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income We currently evaluate the need for this reserve adjustment on an aggregate basis for life insurance products and immediate annuities with life contingencies however the aggregate sufficiency substantially relates to traditional life insurance This liability was zero as of June 30 2017 and December 31 2016 In conjunction with changes to our segments during fourth quarter 2017 we will evaluate reserve adequacy and the need for a reserve adjustment separately for traditional life insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies The Allstate Corporation 47Highlights

costs DAC  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP  We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results Underwriting income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders below.The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Claims and claims expense loss  ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin.We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined ratio the percentage of

with the traditional market the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund FHCF  and the Insurance Linked Securities ILS  market as follows The traditional market placement comprises 269 million of reinsurance limits for losses to personal lines property in Florida arising out of multiple perils The 2017 Excess contract which forms a part of the traditional market placement with 231 million of limits subject to a 20 million retention provides coverage for perils not covered by the FHCF contracts which only cover hurricanes The FHCF contracts provide 90 of 188 million of reinsurance limits or approximately 169 million of limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by storms the National Hurricane Center declares to be hurricanes The ILS placement provides 200 million of reinsurance limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by a Named Storm Event a Severe Thunderstorm Event an Earthquake Event a Wildfire Event a Volcanic Eruption Event or a Meteorite Impact Event.In addition to the Florida program we placed a Gap Fill contract and an Aggregate Excess Catastrophe contract in the second quarter of 2017 as follows The Gap Fill contract forms part of our Nationwide per Occurrence Catastrophe Program that is more fully disclosed in The Allstate Corporation Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31 2017 and

loss trends persist.As we execute on this plan our trusted advisor strategy for Allstate exclusive agencies remains critical This includes enhancements to our approach to initiating relationships building personalized solutions and cultivating trust based relationships We are also focused on broadening our distribution footprint both in terms of agency owners and licensed sales professionals

www.allstate.com Allstate ProtectionAllstate brandEsurance brandEncompass brandSquareTradePaid claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed with a payment or closed without payment Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events The percent change in paid or gross claim frequency is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency Paid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect little differences as timing between opening and settlement is minimal For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period The percent change in paid claim severity is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in paid claim severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid claims severity.Claims is operating in a continuous improvement environment actively focusing on effective loss cost management process efficiency and leveraging emerging

payment via deposit to debit cards We are continuing to aggressively seek new technology and process solutions to provide strong loss cost accuracy efficient processes and customer experiences that are simple fast and produce high degrees of satisfaction While these claims organizational and process changes are occurring frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as changes in claim

bodily injury paid claim severity increased 28.3 and 26.6 in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 respectively compared to the same periods of 2016 These changes are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claim processes in the second half of 2016 related to enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments Paid claim severity was impacted by a reduced number of claims opened and a change in the mix of paid claims toward a higher proportion of larger severity payments and increases in medical inflationary trends that were offset by improvements in loss cost management Homeowners loss ratio increased 0.5 points and 0.1 points in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 respectively

actions that are being implemented in states with inadequate returns while targeted growth plans are being focused on states with adequate returns These actions are tailored based on geography and include higher rates enhanced pricing and underwriting sophistication adopting best in class underwriting and claim processes enhanced product analytics and a focus on geographic presence and product distribution We have implemented actions to improve profitability in states with inadequate returns including announcing exiting operations in Massachusetts in second quarter 2017 These actions have led to a reduction of PIF new issued applications and the renewal ratio compared to prior year for both auto and homeowners.The Allstate Corporation 73Allstate Protection Allstate brandEsurance

January 3 2017 and is focused on providing protection plans covering a wide range of consumer electronic products through retail distribution and mobile operator channels Under these protection plans SquareTrade agrees to repair replace or indemnify the customer for the cost to repair or replace consumer goods from mechanical or electrical failure due to normal wear and tear after expiration of the term of the original manufacturer s warranty and in certain cases accidental damage from handling Premium revenue and claims and claims expense are recognized over the term of the protection plans SquareTrade purchases contractual liability insurance from third party insurance companies to support the settlement of claims in the event SquareTrade is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations under the protection plans The arrangement results in SquareTrade recognizing the costs for settling claims and the insurer recognizing claims costs only in the event SquareTrade is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation or if claims costs are in excess of pre-determined thresholds SquareTrade is generally required to deposit amounts expected to cover losses into a trust held for paying claims.Effective May 1 2017 Allstate Insurance Company AIC  executed a 100 quota share reinsurance agreement with SquareTrade s largest third party insurer to assume the risk on in-force and newly written protection plans This agreement reduces the premiums SquareTrade pays to its largest insurer and AIC has accepted the underwriting risk of that insurer on in-force and new protection plans The insurer has not experienced any losses on the contractual liability insurance contract to date Based on the loss performance through June 30 2017 AIC does not anticipate recognizing losses under its reinsurance agreement on existing in-force business In conjunction with this agreement claims and claims expense benefited by a 6 million pre-tax favorable adjustment for loss experience and Allstate assumed custody for the approximate 200 million in funds held in trust and earmarked for potential future claim payments Investment income on these funds will be earned by SquareTrade SquareTrade s results include the effects of the AIC reinsurance agreement.Underwriting loss totaled 22 million and 57 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 respectively primarily due to 23 million and 46 million respectively of amortization of purchased intangible assets In conjunction with the acquisition we recognized 555 million of intangible assets for which we anticipate recognizing amortization expense of approximately 90 million in 2017 Intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis excluding the SquareTrade brand name which was classified as an infinite-lived intangible and will be tested for impairment on an annual basis with approximately 75 of the balance expected to be amortized by 2021 Premiums written increased 4.9 or 4 million to 85

due to higher limited partnership income including private equity value appreciation and distributions related to the sales of underlying investments The investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities is managed to ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-term returns needed to support this business To better match the long-term nature of our immediate annuities we continue to increase performance-based investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance Economic conditions and equity market performance are reflected in performance-based investment results and income could vary significantly between periods.Net realized capital losses in the second quarter and the first six months of 2017 primarily related to impairment write-downs partially offset by net gains on sales in connection with ongoing portfolio management.Contract benefits in the second quarter of 2017 were comparable to the second quarter of 2016 Contract benefits decreased 1.3 or 4 million in the first six months of 2017 compared to the first six months of 2016

advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-Based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-Based Core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-Based Active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-Based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk Returns are impacted by a variety of factors including general macroeconomic and public market conditions as public benchmarks are often used in the valuation of underlying investments Variability in earnings will also result from the performance of the underlying assets or business and the timing of liquidation of those investments Earnings from the liquidation of investments may be recorded as net investment income or realized capital gains and losses The portfolio which primarily includes private equity real estate infrastructure timber and agriculture-related assets is diversified across a number of characteristics including managers or partners vintage years strategies geographies including international and industry sectors or property types These investments are generally illiquid in nature often require specialized expertise typically involve a third party manager and often enhance returns and income through transformation at the company or property level A portion of these investments seek returns in markets or asset classes that are dislocated or special situations primarily in private markets The

impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge the length of time the contract has been in force distribution channel market interest rates equity market conditions and potential tax implications In addition the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products based on the beginning of year contractholder funds was 6.1 and 6.4 in the first six months of 2017 and 2016 respectively Allstate Financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders however statutory

included in Part I Regulation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31 2016 and Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31 2017.Department of Labor In April 2016 the U.S Department of Labor DOL  issued a rule expanding the range of activities considered to be investment advice  and establishing a new framework for determining whether an entity or person is a fiduciary  when selling mutual funds variable and indexed annuities or variable life products in connection with an Individual Retirement Account IRA  or an employee benefit plan covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended ERISA  The rule in its current form impacts the non-proprietary products provided by Allstate agencies and Allstate s broker-dealer Allstate Financial Services LLC their sales processes and volumes and producer compensation arrangements Allstate does not currently sell proprietary annuities or proprietary variable life products in connection with IRAs or employee benefit plans covered under ERISA Allstate Benefits offers universal life products which when sold in an employee welfare benefit plan may be considered subject to the fiduciary rule as an insurance product with an investment component Products that we previously offered and continue to have in force such as indexed annuities are impacted by the rule These requirements may increase regulatory costs and litigation exposure The financial impact to Allstate is expected to be immaterial The phased implementation of the rule began June 9 2017 with full compliance currently required by January 1 2018 The DOL is engaging in analysis of the issues raised by the President of the United States directing the DOL to examine the fiduciary duty rule to determine whether it may adversely affect investors or retirees or adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice The DOL has issued a Request For Information to assist the DOL in assessing the impact It is yet to be determined whether any other action including changes to the rule s requirements will result from the DOL s continued examination of the rule In addition the new Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman has pledged to work with the DOL Secretary on a fiduciary rule.Dodd-Frank The Secretary of the Treasury operating through Federal Insurance Office FIO  and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative USTR  are jointly authorized pursuant to Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank  to negotiate a Covered Agreement with one or more foreign governments authorities or regulatory entities A Covered Agreement is a written bilateral or multilateral agreement that relates to the recognition of prudential measures with respect to the business of insurance or reinsurance that achieves a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation A Covered Agreement may become effective 90 days after the Secretary of the Treasury and USTR jointly submit a final agreement to the House Financial Services House Ways and Means Senate Banking and Senate Finance committees The House and Senate committees are not required to vote on the Covered Agreement for it to become effective Following expiration of the 90 day holdover period the U.S Treasury Secretary and USTR must sign a Covered Agreement for it to become effective As provided in Dodd-Frank a Covered Agreement cannot preempt i.e displace state insurance measures that govern an insurer s rates premiums underwriting or sales practices any state insurance coverage requirements the application of antitrust laws of any state to the business of insurance or any state insurance measure governing insurer capital or solvency except where a state insurance measure results in less favorable treatment of a non-U.S insurer than a U.S insurer In November 2015 Treasury and USTR notified Congress that they were formally initiating negotiations on a Covered Agreement with the EU the Covered Agreement  addressing permanent equivalence treatment of the U.S regulatory system by the EU confidential sharing of information across jurisdictions and uniform treatment of EU-based reinsurers operating in the U.S including with respect to reinsurance collateral On January 13 2017 the Secretary of the Treasury and USTR jointly submitted a Covered Agreement consistent with their November 2015 notification to Congress The Covered Agreement submitted was designed to secure equivalence treatment of the U.S regulatory system by the EU address the confidential sharing of information by regulators across jurisdictions and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for EU-based foreign reinsurers in all States that meet certain conditions In accordance with authorities provided in Dodd-Frank the Covered Agreement may preempt i.e displace state laws after 60 months from its effective date if then existing State insurance measures affected by the Covered Agreement result in less favorable treatment of an EU insurer or reinsurer subject to the Covered Agreement than a U.S insurer domiciled licensed or otherwise admitted in a U.S State On July 14 2017 the U.S Department of the Treasury and USTR announced their
