commonly achieved fourth quarter As result revenue production generally highest fourth quarter year.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe preparation financial statements conformity GAAP requires management make estimates assumptions affect financial statements disclosures Some estimates assumptions require application difficult subjective and/or complex judgment effect matters inherently uncertain may change subsequent periods We required make estimates assumptions applying following accounting policies:Acquisitions Operating Properties Note 3)Acquisitions properties accounted utilizing acquisition method accounting accordingly results operations acquired properties included results operations respective dates acquisition Estimates future cash flows valuation techniques used allocate purchase price acquired property land buildings improvements equipment debt liabilities assumed identifiable intangible assets liabilities amounts related in-place tenant leases acquired below-market tenant ground leases tenant relationships No significant value ascribed tenant relationships.The fair values tangible assets determined vacant basis The vacant fair value allocated land applicable buildings equipment tenant improvements based comparable sales relevant information respect property Specifically vacant value buildings equipment calculated using cost approach utilizing published guidelines current replacement cost actual construction costs similar recently developed properties income approach Assumptions used income approach value buildings include capitalization discount rates lease-up

occupancy level property lost revenues period necessary lease-up vacant current occupancy level Such estimates include fair value leasing commissions legal costs tenant coordination costs would incurred lease property occupancy level Additionally evaluate time period occupancy level would achieved include estimate net operating costs primarily real estate taxes insurance utilities incurred lease-up period generally ranges one year The fair value acquired in-place tenant leases included balance buildings equipment amortized remaining lease term tenant.Identifiable intangible assets

owned joint ventures controlling financial interest ability exercise significant influence accounted using equity method.We continually analyze assess reconsideration events including changes factors mentioned determine consolidation treatment remains appropriate Decisions regarding consolidation partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment management Errors assessment consolidation could result material changes consolidated financial statements.Revenue Recognition Related MattersMinimum rent revenues recognized straight-line basis terms related operating leases Minimum rent revenues also include lease termination income collected tenants allow tenant vacate space prior scheduled termination dates well accretion related below-market tenant leases acquired properties properties fair valued emergence bankruptcy.In leasing tenant space may provide funding lessee tenant allowance In accounting tenant allowance determine whether allowance represents funding

leasehold improvements related lease term If tenant allowance represents payment purpose funding leasehold improvements event considered owner improvements accounting purposes allowance considered lease incentive recognized lease term reduction rental revenue straight-line basis.Overage rent paid tenant tenant's sales exceed agreed upon minimum amount recognized accrual basis tenant sales exceed contractual tenant lease thresholds calculated multiplying sales excess minimum amount percentage defined lease Recoveries tenants established leases computed based upon formula related real estate taxes insurance property operating expenses generally recognized revenues period related costs incurred.Real estate sales recognized whenever 1 sale consummated 2 buyer demonstrated adequate

provide allowance doubtful accounts portion accounts receivable including straight-line rents estimated uncollectible Such allowances reviewed periodically based upon recovery history.ImpairmentOperating propertiesWe regularly review consolidated properties potential impairment indicators whenever events changes circumstances indicate carrying amount may recoverable Impairment indicators assessed separately property include limited significant decreases real estate property net operating income significant decreases occupancy percentage debt maturities management's intent respect properties prevailing market conditions.38Table ContentsIf indicator potential impairment exists property tested recoverability comparing carrying amount estimated future

provision allocated proportionately adjust carrying amount asset group The adjusted carrying amount represents new cost basis property depreciated remaining useful life property.Although may market property sale assurance transaction complete sale finalized However GAAP requires us utilize Company's expected holding period properties assessing recoverability If cannot recover carrying value properties within planned holding period estimate fair values assets record impairment charges properties estimated fair value less carrying value.Impairment indicators pre-development costs typically
