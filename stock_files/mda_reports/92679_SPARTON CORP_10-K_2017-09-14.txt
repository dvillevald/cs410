customers long-term contracts require lot acceptance testing The new policy continues recognize revenue percentage completion method changes measurement progress contracts completed units accepted basis whereby revenue recognized lot sonobuoys produced lot formally accepted customer units-of-production basis whereby revenue recognized production internal testing lot sonobuoys completed The Company significant experience producing sonobuoys customer specifications internal testing assess compliance specifications adequate history continuous customer acceptance sonobuoys produced Accordingly Company believes new method preferable primarily eliminates delays revenue related cost goods sold recognition due timing customer testing acceptance delays Such delays commonly occur due customer circumstances unrelated product produced Under new policy revenue related costs goods sold manufactured sonobuoy lots closely match period product produced related revenue earned thereby better reflecting economic activity ECP segment Additionally new method provides better matching periodic operating expenses incurred production The Company additionally certain long-term contracts accounted percentage-of-completion method accounting whereby contract revenues recognized pro-rata basis based upon ratio costs incurred compared total estimated contract costs Contract costs include labor material placed production well allocation indirect costs Losses entire amount long-term contracts recognized period losses determinable Significant judgment exercised determining estimated
