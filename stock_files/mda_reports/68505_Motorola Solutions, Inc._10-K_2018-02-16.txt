Africa Latin America To extent unable sell receivables terms acceptable us may retain exposure credit quality customers finance Customers Inability Obtain Financing Make Purchases Motorola Solutions and/or Maintain Their Business Some customers require substantial financing including public financing government grants order fund operations make purchases us The inability customers obtain sufficient credit funds including result lower tax revenues currency fluctuations unavailability government grants finance purchases products services and/or meet payment obligations us could cases negative impact financial results This risk increases size length contracts increase In addition global economic conditions result insolvencies customers negatively impact financial results Challenges Budgeting Forecasting It difficult estimate changes various parts U.S world economy including markets participate Components budgeting forecasting dependent upon estimates demand products estimates foreign exchange rates The prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates future income expenditures challenging Potential Deferment Cancellation Purchases Orders Customers Uncertainty current future global economic conditions may cause cases caused businesses governments defer cancel purchases response tighter credit decreased cash availability de-prioritization communications equipment within budgeting process If future demand products declines due economic conditions negatively impact financial results.8 Inability Operate Grow Certain Markets We operate number markets risk intensifying political instability including Europe Russia Brazil Middle East Africa If political instability continues markets parts world operate could significant impact ability grow cases operate locations negatively impact financial results.A security breach significant disruption IT systems outsource partners suppliers manufacture install cases operate maintain customers caused cyber attack means could negative impact operations sales operating results.All information technology systems potentially vulnerable damage unauthorized access interruption variety sources including limited cyber attack cyber intrusion computer viruses security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism sabotage war insider trading telecommunication failures As provider mission-critical communications systems customers critical infrastructure sectors U.S globally including systems operate maintain certain customers face additional risk target sophisticated attacks aimed compromising Company customers sensitive information intellectual property means referred advanced persistent threats This risk heightened systems may contain sensitive governmental information personally identifiable protected information While employ number countermeasures security controls including training audits utilization commercial information security threat sharing networks protect attacks along industry experienced gradual steady increase sophistication threats noticeably well-crafted social engineering phishing attempts We cannot guarantee threat attempts successfully thwarted even countermeasures therefore investing detection response capabilities minimize potential impacts Further dependent certain instances upon outsourced business partners suppliers customers adequately protect IT systems IT systems manage customers In addition customers exploring broadband solutions use public carrier networks solutions would operate We direct oversight influence public carrier networks manage security quality resiliency networks attractive high value target due role critical infrastructure expose customers elevated risk private networks.Our Company outsources certain business operations including limited IT HR information systems manufacturing repair distribution engineering services These arrangements governed various contracts agreements reference mandate Company international standards information protection appropriate In addition maintain certain networked equipment customer locations reliant customers protect maintain equipment The attack surface us protect adversaries thus often extended partners customers well suppliers dependency upon cyber security capabilities well willingness exchange threat response information usA cyber attack significant disruption involving IT systems outsource partners suppliers customers could result unauthorized release proprietary confidential sensitive information customers Such unauthorized access release information could allow others unfairly compete us ii compromise safety security given mission-critical nature customers systems iii subject us claims breach contract tort civil claims iv damage reputation We could face regulatory penalties enforcement actions remediation obligations and/or private litigation parties whose data improperly disclosed misused In addition sharp increase laws Europe U.S elsewhere imposing requirements handling personal data including data employees consumers business contacts well imposing requirements remediation action including specific timing method notification There risk Company directly result third-party service provider use could found failed comply laws regulations country regarding collection consent handling transfer retention disposal personal data therefore subject us fines sanctions The European Courts invalidation Safe Harbor mechanism legitimize cross border data flows increases risk Company directly third-party service provider use may inappropriately transfer EU personal data Any foregoing could negative impact business financial condition results operations cash flow.A significant amount international business transacted local currency significant percentage cash cash equivalents held outside United States exposes us risk relating currency fluctuations changes foreign exchange regulations repatriation delays costs could negatively impact sales profitability financial flexibility.We sizable sales operations Canada Europe Middle East Africa Asia Latin America regions.A significant amount business transacted local currency As result financial performance impacted currency fluctuations We also experiencing increased pressure agree established currency conversion rates cost living adjustments result foreign currency fluctuations requirement transact business local currencies.A significant percentage cash cash equivalents currently held outside U.S continue generate profits outside U.S many liabilities public debt majority pension liabilities certain cash payments dividends share repurchases payable U.S While regularly repatriated funds minimal adverse impact repatriation funds could continue subject delay local country approvals could potential adverse tax consequences In addition foreign exchange regulations may limit ability convert repatriate foreign currency As result lower amount cash cash equivalents U.S financial flexibility may reduced.9We face uncertainty global geopolitical landscape may impede implementation strategy outside United States.In June 2016 United Kingdom U.K held referendum voters approved exit European Union E.U commonly referred Brexit It expected U.K government initiate process withdraw E.U begin negotiating terms separation The announcement Brexit resulted volatility global stock market currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted strengthening U.S dollar relative foreign currencies conduct business The announcement Brexit likely withdrawal U.K E.U may also create global economic uncertainty may cause customers closely monitor costs reduce spending budgets In addition may uncertainty position United States take respect certain treaty trade relationships countries This uncertainty may impact ability willingness non-U.S companies transact business United States including Company ii regulation trade agreements affecting U.S companies iii global stock markets iv general global economic conditions All factors outside control may cause us adjust strategy order compete effectively global markets could adversely affect business financial condition operating results cash flows.A portion business dependent upon U.S government contracts grants highly regulated subject oversight audits U.S government representatives subject cancellations Such audits could result adverse findings negatively impact business.Our U.S government business subject specific procurement regulations numerous compliance requirements These requirements although customary government contracting U.S increase performance compliance costs These costs may increase future thereby reducing margins could adverse effect financial condition Failure comply regulations compliance requirements could lead suspension debarment U.S government contracting subcontracting period time Among causes debarment violations various laws policies including related procurement integrity export control U.S government security regulations employment practices protection criminal justice data protection environment accuracy records proper recording costs foreign corruption False Claims Act.Generally U.S government contracts grants subject oversight audits government representatives Such audits could result adjustments contracts Any costs found improperly allocated specific contract may allowed costs already reimbursed may refunded Future audits adjustments required may materially reduce revenues profits upon completion final negotiation audits Negative audit findings could also result investigations termination contract grant forfeiture profits reimbursements suspension payments fines suspension prohibition business U.S government All contracts U.S government subject cancellation convenience U.S government.In addition contacts government officials participation political activities areas tightly controlled federal state local international laws Failure comply laws could cost us opportunities seek certain government sales opportunities even result fines prosecution debarment.Government regulation radio frequencies may limit growth public safety broadband systems reduce barriers entry new competitors.Radio frequencies required provide wireless services The allocation frequencies regulated U.S countries limited spectrum allocated wireless services specifically public safety users The growth public safety broadband communications systems may affected regulations relating access allocated spectrum public safety users ii adequate frequencies allocated iii new technologies developed better utilize frequencies currently allocated use Industry growth may also affected new licensing fees required use frequencies.The U.S leads world allocating spectrum enable wireless communications including LTE Other countries also allocated spectrum allow deployment technologies This changing landscape may introduce new competition new opportunities us.MSI opportunities sell LTE equipment related software services U.S substantially impacted 1 AT&T's success satisfying contract requirements milestones including among others subscriber adoption rate mandatory payments FirstNet coverage 2 fiscal public regulatory policies and/or special interest politics risk delaying deployment.We derive portion revenue government customers award business competitive bidding involve significant upfront costs risks This effort may result awards business may fail accurately estimate costs fulfill contracts awarded us could adverse consequences future profitability.Many government customers including U.S government customers award business competitive bidding process results greater competition increased pricing pressure The competitive bidding process involves significant cost managerial time prepare bids contracts may awarded us Even awarded contracts may fail accurately estimate resources costs required fulfill contract resolve problems subcontractors suppliers could negatively impact profitability contract award us particularly case 10fixed price contracts In addition following award contract experienced may continue experience significant expense delay contract modification contract rescission result customer delay competitors protesting challenging contracts awarded us competitive bidding.We enter fixed-price contracts could subject us losses event fail properly estimate costs hedge risks associated currency fluctuations.We enter number firm fixed-price contracts If initial cost estimates incorrect lose money contracts Because certain contracts involve new technologies applications require us engage subcontractors and/or last multiple years unforeseen events technological difficulties fluctuations price raw materials problems subcontractors suppliers cost overruns result contract pricing becoming less favorable even unprofitable us adverse impact financial results In addition significant increase inflation rates currency fluctuations could adverse impact profitability longer-term contracts.The expansion solutions services business creates new competitors new increased areas risk exposed past may able properly assess mitigate.We plan continue expand solutions services business offering additional expanded managed services existing new types customers designing building operating managing cases owning public safety system commercial system The offering managed services involves integration multiple services multiple vendors multiple technologies requiring partner solutions services providers often multiyear projects.Additionally managed services business expanded include hosting software applications This allows customers consume software service avoid costs complexities acquiring operating software We may recognize revenue time services offering rather point time traditional equipment sale extend revenue recognition length services contracts may several years The managed services business one characterized large subcontracting arrangements may able obtain favorable contract terms including adequate indemnities performance commitments protections subcontractors adequately mitigate exposure customers We may face increasing competition traditional system integrators defense industry solutions services contracts become larger complicated Expansion bring us contact new regulatory requirements restrictions data security data residency/localization obligations comply may increase costs business reduce margins delay limit range new solutions services able offer We may required agree specific performance metrics meet customer's requirements network security availability reliability maintenance support cases performance metrics met may paid.We may continue access capital markets financing acceptable terms conditions particularly credit ratings downgraded could limit ability repay indebtedness could cause liquidity issues.From time time access capital markets obtain financing Our access capital markets bank credit markets acceptable terms conditions impacted many factors including credit ratings ii liquidity overall capital markets iii strength credit availability banking markets iv current state global economy In addition frequently access credit markets obtain performance bonds bid bonds standby letters credit surety bonds well hedge foreign exchange risk sell receivables In addition assurances able refinance existing indebtedness commercially reasonable terms ii terms including respect interest rates favorable current debt iii There assurances continue access capital markets bank credit markets terms acceptable us unable repay refinance debt cannot guarantee able generate enough cash flows operations able obtain enough capital service debt fund planned capital expenditures pay future dividends.We rated investment grade three national rating agencies Any downward changes rating agencies credit rating may negatively impact value liquidity debt equity securities Under certain circumstances increase interest rate payable us revolving credit facility amounts borrowed facility could negatively affect operating cash flows In addition downgrade credit ratings could limit ability access capital markets bank credit markets ii provide performance bonds bid bonds standby letters credit surety bonds iii hedge foreign exchange risk iv fund foreign affiliates v sell receivables A downgrade credit rating could also result less favorable trade terms suppliers In addition downgrades credit ratings may affect ability obtain additional financing future may affect terms financing Any future disruptions uncertainty volatility capital markets may result higher funding costs us adversely affect ability access funds credit related products In addition may avoid taking actions would otherwise benefit us stockholders engaging certain acquisitions engaging stock repurchases would negatively impact credit rating.11Our future operating results depend ability purchase acceptable prices sufficient amount materials parts components well services software meet demands customers disruption suppliers significant increase price supplies could negative impact results operations.Our ability meet customers demands depends part ability timely obtain adequate delivery quality materials parts components well services software suppliers In addition certain supplies including critical components available single source limited sources may able diversify sources timely manner If demand products services increases current expectations suppliers unable meet demand reasons including result natural disasters financial issues could experience interruption supplies significant increase price supplies including result move alternative source could negative impact business result increased cost delay inability deliver products This risk may increase result consolidation certain suppliers We experienced shortages past negatively impacted results operations may experience shortages future In addition credit constraints suppliers could cause us accelerate payment accounts payable us impacting cash flow.We seen expect continue see increases price certain supplies longer qualify certain volume discounts given significant decrease direct material spend last several years result spin-offs divestitures We also experienced less support focus suppliers spend diminished making difficult us resolve gaps supply due unforeseen changes forecast demand In addition current contractual arrangements certain suppliers may cancelled extended suppliers therefore afford us sufficient protection reduction interruption supplies Moreover event suppliers breach contracts us legal remedies associated breach may insufficient compensate us damages may suffer.Over last several years outsourced portions certain business operations like IT HR information systems manufacturing repair distribution engineering services expect outsource additional business operations This outsourcing limits control business operations exposes us additional risk result actions outsource partners.As outsource business operations able directly control activities Our outsource partners may prioritize business customers may meet desired level quality performance service cost reductions metrics Failure meet key performance indicators may result default customers In addition may rely outsource partners secure materials suppliers outsource partners may existing relationships may required continue manage relationships even outsource certain business operations.As outsource business operations become dependent IT systems outsource partners including transmit demand purchase orders suppliers result delay order placement In addition effort reduce costs limit liabilities outsource partners may robust systems make commitments timely manner require.In cases actions outsource partners may result found violation laws regulations like import export regulations As many outsource partners operate outside U.S outsourcing activity exposes us information security vulnerabilities increases global risks In addition exposed financial viability outsource partners Once business activity outsourced may contractually prohibited may practically able bring activity back within Company move another outsource partner The actions outsource partners could result reputational damage us could negatively impact business financial conditions results operations cash flows.Our sales within quarter linear substantial percentage products shipping final month quarter This lack linearity creates inefficiencies business performance interruption final month could substantial impact quarterly financial results.On average substantial percentage quarterly sales ship final month quarter Any interruption ability ship products final month unavailability critical components disruption manufacturing capabilities disruptions distribution channel disproportionately large impact quarterly financial results may unable recover time ship products recognize revenue quarter.In addition lack linearity results inefficiencies financial performance must invest capacity resources support business model meaning underutilized operations first two months quarter We also must maintain additional component inventory engage pre-builds finished goods mitigate impact lack linearity meet potential last month demand This could result carrying excess inventory costly may result increased inventory obsolescence time.12We longer certain logos trademarks trade names service marks including MOTOROLA MOTO MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS Stylized M logo derivatives formatives thereof Motorola Marks license
