propane butane naphtha feedstocks The Corporation also purchases certain monomers primarily ethylene propylene supplement internal production well raw materials The Corporation purchases natural gas primarily generate electricity purchases electric power.Feedstock energy costs generally follow price trends crude oil natural gas sometimes volatile Ultimately ability pass underlying cost increases dependent market conditions Conversely feedstock energy costs decline selling prices generally decline well As result volatility costs could impact Corporation's results operations.While Corporation expects abundant cost-advantaged supplies natural gas liquids NGLs United States persist foreseeable future NGLs become significantly less advantaged crude oil-based feedstocks could negative impact Corporation's results operations future investments Also Corporation's key suppliers feedstocks energy unable provide raw materials required production could negative impact Corporation's results operations.Supply/Demand Balance Earnings generated Corporation vary based part balance supply relative demand within industry.The balance supply relative demand within industry may significantly
