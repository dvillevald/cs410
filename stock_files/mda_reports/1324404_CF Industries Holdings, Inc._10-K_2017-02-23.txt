dietary habits planted acreage application rates among things We expect key variables continue major impacts long-term fertilizer demand foreseeable future Short-term fertilizer demand depends global economic conditions weather patterns level global grain stocks relative consumption governmental regulations including requirements mandating increased use bio-fuels farm sector income Other geopolitical factors like temporary disruptions fertilizer trade related government intervention changes buying/selling patterns key exporting/consuming countries China India Russia Brazil among others often play major role shaping near-term market fundamentals The economics nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play key role decisions increase reduce production capacity Supply fertilizers generally driven available capacity operating rates raw material costs availability government policies global trade Raw materials dependent energy sources natural gas coal supply costs affected supply demand commodities Over last decade strong demand high capacity utilization increasing operating margins result higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment nitrogen production facilities resulted increase global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity As result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating current global oversupply market leading lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices In addition lower global production costs driven lower feedstock costs foreign exchange rate changes reduced ocean freight costs contributed lower priced environment.Global Trade FertilizerIn addition relationship global supply demand profitability within particular geographic region determined supply/demand balance within region Regional supply demand influenced significantly factors affecting trade within regions Some factors include relative cost produce deliver product relative currency values availability credit governmental trade policies The development additional natural gas reserves North America last decade decreased natural gas costs relative rest world making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers competitive These lower natural gas costs contributed announcements several nitrogen fertilizer capacity expansion projects North America including capacity expansion projects Donaldsonville

ConditionsOur 2016 results impacted excess global nitrogen supply resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices The U.S Gulf major global fertilizer pricing point due volume nitrogen fertilizer trades Through 2016 nitrogen pricing U.S Gulf declined often trading parity international pricing points due excess global nitrogen supply result continued imports various exporting regions decreased buyer interest Seasonal decreases agricultural demand combined delayed customer purchasing activity resulted multi-year lows nitrogen fertilizer selling prices second half year The average selling price products 2016 217 per ton compared 314 per ton 2015 decrease 31 resulting decrease net sales gross margin approximately 1.38 billion periods The decline selling prices impacted reportable segments In addition periods declining prices customers tend delay purchasing fertilizer anticipation prices future lower current prices also negatively impacted sales volume.In fourth quarter 2016 following developments impacted global nitrogen fertilizer market A decline Chinese nitrogen fertilizer operating rates due rising production costs lower global selling prices led reduced Chinese urea supply availability China international markets Higher global oil prices resulted higher effective natural gas prices Europe Russia contributed increasing nitrogen fertilizer manufacturers production costs regions Customers delayed purchasing fourth quarter 2016 reduced inventory levels supply chain Increases demand caused higher pricing 2016 ended customers began taking deliveries anticipation 2017 spring application season.These factors led increase global nitrogen pricing end 2016 A significant amount new nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 additional production capacity expected come line 2017 including significant increase production capacity located North America The new capacity increase supply We expect nitrogen fertilizer prices rise going 2017 spring application season
