and Pricing Trends Although year over year net sales were down 2.7 in the combined periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 sales volumes increased on virtually all the products the Company sells Overall the Company's average tons shipped per day in 2017 were 8.9 higher than 2016 Pricing also improved for many of the Company's core products with the exception of pricing decreases in two of the Company's most significant products aluminum and stainless Also net sales in the year ended December 31 2016 included the Company's 27.1 million sale of its entire inventory at its Houston and Edmonton facilities to an unrelated third party The sale of this inventory was the result of a strategic decision to lower the Company's exposure to oil and gas market fluctuations Including that sale of inventory net sales in the year ended December 31 2016 from the Houston and Edmonton locations which were closed in February 2016 were 33.0 million Industry data provided by the Metals Service Center Institute MSCI indicates that overall 2017 U.S steel service center shipment volumes increased 5 compared to 2016 levels According to MSCI data industry sales volumes of products consistent with the Company's product mix increased 7 in 2017 compared to 2016 All of the U.S steel service center products tracked by the MSCI had shipment volume increases in 2017 compared to 2016 with the exception of carbon pipe and tube products which had a decrease The products which had the most significant increases according to MSCI data included carbon alloy bar cold finished carbon bar and SBQ carbon bar The MSCI data included more modest sales volume increases for carbon plate aluminum and stainless products The Company's operating results for both its successor and predecessor periods in 2017 were positively impacted by the increased demand for its products which in the aggregate outpaced the demand increase reported by the MSCI As a result of the Company's recent restructuring activities which management believes lowered the variable and fixed costs contributing to each ton sold by the Company the increased demand allowed the Company to experience operating margin growth and therefore growth in operating margin dollars in the combined periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 The demand for the Company's products may change from time to time based on among other things general economic conditions industry capacity and the cyclical nature of the industries in which the Company's customers operate A decrease in the demand for the Company's products has a significant impact on the Company's operating results A decrease in demand results in lower sales dollars which once costs and expenses are factored in leads to less dollars 21earned from normal operations Although the lower demand also decreases the cost of materials and operating costs including warehouse delivery selling general and administrative expenses the decrease in these costs and expenses is often less than the decrease in sales dollars due to fixed costs resulting in lower operating margins Management believes its recent restructuring activities have put the Company is a better position to react to variability in end-market demand and manage the impact that demand variability might have on operating margins Management also believes the Company's overall operating results will continue to be significantly impacted by the pricing of its products which in many cases can have a more significant impact on the Company's operating results than demand because of the following reasons among others Changes in volume resulting from changes in demand typically result in corresponding changes to the Company s variable costs However as pricing changes occur variable expenses are not directly impacted If surcharges are not passed through to the customer or are passed through without a mark-up the Company s profitability will be adversely impacted.Although pricing for many of the Company's products improved in 2017 compared to the historically low prices witnessed in 2016 the pricing environment remains competitive which coupled with the Company's aggressive sales pricing to sell excess and slower moving inventory and residual financial impacts of its recent reorganization tempered the gross material margins achieved by the Company in 2017 Despite this overall the gross material margin achieved by the Company calculated as net sales less cost of materials divided by net sales increased from 21.0 in 2016 to 24.0 in the combined successor and predecessor periods in 2017 Cost of materials for 2016 included 27.1 million from the sale of all inventory at the Houston and Edmonton facilities to an unrelated third party at a zero gross profit margin and 14.2 million of aged and excess inventory that was sold for 2.5 million Excluding these specified items gross margin for 2016 was 22.1 The Company was able to improve its gross margin from 2016 by implementing improved inventory management strategies and though not fully matured the better matching sales prices with the inventory replacement cost Although pricing uncertainty remains in the market the Company expects its margins will continue to improve in 2018 as its excess inventory is sold and replaced with inventory better matched to the current market conditions Current Business Outlook With the February 2016 closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities which primarily serviced the oil and gas sector of the energy market the Company became principally focused on two key markets aerospace and industrial.The aerospace market continues to be strong with defense and commercial spending driving the demand for the Company's aluminum and stainless products The Company expects the aerospace market to remain stable and for business to improve particularly where the Company has long-term contracts with subcontractors who support platforms that are anticipated to grow However the Company does anticipate continued pressure on transactional pricing resulting from competition in the market General sentiment in the industrial market has improved with mining heavy machinery and light vehicles all having a positive outlook Given the Company's lower cost structure which is the result of its restructuring activities it does see an opportunity to grow market share by improving its conversion rate on transactional business on a competitive basis at still accretive net margins As expected pricing for many of the Company's products began to rise in 2017 The Company was not able to fully benefit from the improved pricing environment however as it continues to aggressively sell its excess and slower moving inventory at lower gross material margins and due to residual financial impacts of its recent financial reorganization Management projects that its gross material margins will improve in 2018 as a result of better matching of inventory sales prices with the inventory replacement cost and increasing sales prices which the Company believes it will be able to pass on to its customers The Company expects uncertainty to contribute to a competitive pricing environment in 2018 particularly given the recent enactment of a 25 tariff on steel and a 10 tariff on aluminum imported from all countries except Canada and Mexico under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 However given its long-standing relationships with domestic steel mills the Company also believes it is currently well-positioned to take advantage of an increasing pricing environment expected to result from the tariffs and may have a competitive price advantage relative to other U.S based steel service centers that are more reliant on imported steel and aluminum products 22RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our discussion of comparative period results is based upon the following components of the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Income.Net Sales The Company derives its sales from the processing and delivery of metals Pricing is established with each customer order and includes charges for the material processing activities and delivery The pricing varies by product line and type of processing From time to time the Company may enter into fixed price arrangements with customers while simultaneously obtaining similar agreements with its suppliers Cost of Materials Cost of materials consists of the costs that the Company pays suppliers for metals and related inbound freight charges excluding depreciation and amortization which are included in operating costs and expenses discussed below Operating Costs and Expenses Operating costs and expenses primarily consist of Warehouse processing and delivery expenses including occupancy costs compensation and employee benefits for warehouse personnel processing shipping and handling costs Sales expenses including compensation and employee benefits for sales personnel General and administrative expenses including compensation for executive officers and general management expenses for professional services primarily related to accounting and legal advisory services bad debt expense data communication and computer hardware and maintenance Restructuring expense net including moving costs associated with plant consolidations employee termination and related benefits costs associated with workforce reductions lease termination costs and other exit costs and Depreciation and amortization expenses including depreciation for all owned property and equipment and amortization of various intangible assets amortization in predecessor period only Presentation of Predecessor and Successor The Company adopted fresh-start reporting as of the Effective Date As a result of the application of fresh-start reporting the Company's financial statements for periods prior to the Effective Date are not comparable to those for periods subsequent to the Effective Date References in this report to Successor  refer to the Company on or after the Effective Date References to Predecessor  refer to the Company prior to the Effective Date Operating results for the Successor and Predecessor periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year References such as the Company we our  and us  refer to A.M Castle Co and its consolidated subsidiaries whether Predecessor and/or Successor as appropriate In the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and liquidity the Company compares certain financial information for the year ended December 31 2017 to the year ended December 31 2016 The Company believes that in certain instances combining the financial results when discussing the Predecessor and Successor periods within the year ended December 31 2017 is useful for management and investors to assess the Company's ongoing financial and operational performance and trends 23Periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to the Year Ended December 31 2016 Predecessor)The following table sets forth certain statement of operations data for the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor and for the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Included in the operating results below for the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor is the sale of all inventory and subsequent closure of the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities which occurred in the first quarter of 2016 Successor Predecessor September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Year Ended December 31 2016 Favorable

were a decrease of 14.3 million or 2.7 compared to the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Net sales in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor included the Company's 27.1 million sale of its entire inventory at its Houston and Edmonton facilities to an unrelated third party The sale of this inventory which was sold at a zero gross margin calculated as net sales less cost of materials was the result of a strategic decision to lower the Company's exposure to oil and gas market fluctuations Including that sale of inventory net sales in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor from the Houston and Edmonton locations which were closed in February 2016 were 33.0 million Despite the closure of these two locations the Company posted an 8.9 increase in tons sold per day to customers in 2017 compared to 2016 Excluding the tons sold from the Houston and Edmonton locations in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor tons sold per day increased 10.2 Tons sold per day increased for most of the products the Company sells with the largest improvements in alloy bar and carbon and alloy plate Offsetting the positive impact of the increase in sales volumes was an overall 4.7 decrease in average selling prices.In 2017 the average selling prices for most of the Company's products improved compared to the historically low average selling prices in 2016 However a decrease in the average selling price of aluminum and a slight decrease in the average selling price of stainless two of the highest contributing products in the Company's sales mix resulted in an overall 4.7 decrease in average selling prices Cost of MaterialsCost of materials exclusive of depreciation and amortization were 127.8 million in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and 266.5 million in the period January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to 421.3 million in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor The 27.0 million or 6.4 decrease in the combined 2017 periods as compared to 2016 is mainly due to the 27.1 million of cost of materials recognized on the sale of all inventory at the Company's Houston and Edmonton facilities in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor as discussed above partially offset by the increase in sales volume in the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Also in an effort to reduce the amount of aged and excess inventory on hand cost of materials in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor included 24$14.2 million of aged and excess inventory that was sold for 2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 which increased the operating loss in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor by 11.7 million Cost of materials exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased to 77.5 of net sales in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor from 75.3 of net sales in the period January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor due mainly to aggressive product pricing and sales of aged and excess inventory in the period and lower average tons sold per day in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 compared to the prior eight month period Cost of materials was 79.0 of net sales in the year ended year ended December

capital are highlighted below Higher accounts receivable at both December 31 2017 Successor and August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to December 31 2016 Predecessor resulted in 2.2 million and 6.1 million of cash flow use compared to a 6.1 million cash flow source in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor The higher accounts receivable balance at both December 31 2017 Successor and August 31 2017 Predecessor was a result of the timing of certain customer payments Average receivable days outstanding was 53.3 days in the year ended December 31 2017 and 54.0 days in the year ended December 31 2016 Higher inventory levels at both December 31 2017 Successor and August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to December 31 2016 Predecessor used 2.0 million and 2.7 million of cash respectively while lower inventory levels at December 31 2016 Predecessor compared to the prior year end 2015 were a 65.7 million cash flow source in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor The cash flow source from inventory in year ended December 31 2016 was attributable to the previously discussed Houston and Edmonton inventory sale as well as approximately 23.8 million in inventory reductions related to scrapping restructuring activities Average days sales in inventory was 140.6 days in the year ended December 31 2017 as compared to 168.1 days in the year ended December 31 2016 The decrease in average days sales in inventory in 2017 compared to 2016 resulted primarily from continued improvement in inventory management offset somewhat by the Houston and Edmonton inventory sale and scrapping restructuring activities in 2016 The Company's inventory management strategy is focused on adjusting its inventory deployment initiatives to better align inventory at its facilities with the needs of the customers specific to that facility In 2017 the Company's successful execution of that strategy resulting in days sales in inventory surpassing the Company's original target of approximately 150 days Total accounts payable accrued payroll and employee benefits and accrued and other current liabilities used cash of 4.4 million in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and provided a cash flow source of 2.6 million in the period January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor compared to a use of cash of 14.7 million over the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Accounts payable days outstanding were 41.4 days in the year ended December 31 2017 and 43.3 days in the same period last year Net cash used in investing activities of 3.7 million in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor were almost entirely the result of cash paid for capital expenditures Net cash from investing activities of 5.3 million in the period January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor is mainly due to a 7.5 million reduction in the cash collateralization requirements of outstanding letters of credit offset by cash paid for capital expenditures of 2.9 million in the period Net cash from investing activities of 76.9 million in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor is mainly attributable to cash proceeds from the sale of TPI and the sale of the Company's 50 ownership in Kreher partially offset by a cash outflow of 8.0 million used to cash collateralize letters of credit that were issued under the Company's previous asset-based lending facility which was replaced in the year ended December 31 2016.Net cash from financing activities of 24.7 million in the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor was the result of proceeds from borrowings under the Company's New ABL Facility as well as net proceeds from short-term borrowings under the Company's foreign line of credit During the period January 1 2017 through 28August 31 2017 Predecessor net cash from financing activities of 18.6 million was mainly attributable to proceeds and repayments of debt in connection with the Company's bankruptcy proceedings and included the initial borrowings and subsequent repayment of the Debtor-in-Possession Revolving Credit and Security Agreement dated as of June 10 2017 DIP Facility borrowings under the New ABL Facility cash proceeds from the issuance of the Second Lien Notes and repayment of the prepetition First Lien Notes as well as proceeds from short-term borrowings under the Company's foreign line of credit Offsetting these net cash proceeds were a payment of 3.0 million made in connection with the Company's build-to-suit liability associated with its warehouse in Janesville WI In the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor all available proceeds from the sales of TPI and Kreher were used to pay down the Company's long-term debt which along with the 9.8 million payment of debt restructuring costs and 2.5 million payment of debt issuance costs resulted in net cash used in financing activities of 16.5 million in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor In December 2016 the Company entered into the Credit Facilities as defined below with certain financial institutions the Financial Institutions in order to replace and repay outstanding borrowings and support the

a going concern Capital ExpendituresCash paid for capital expenditures was 3.7 million and 2.9 million in the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor respectively compared to 3.5 million in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Expenditures in the 2017 periods include approximately 0.3 million for leasehold improvements at the Company's warehouse in Janesville Wisconsin and 0.4 million related to software licenses and IT equipment The balance of the capital expenditures in the 2017 periods is the result of 31normal equipment building improvement and furniture and fixture upgrades throughout the year Management believes that capital expenditures will be approximately 6.5 million to 7.5 million in 2018.Pension FundingThe Company s funding policy on its defined benefit pension plans is to satisfy the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA  Future funding requirements are dependent upon various factors outside the Company s control including but not limited to fund asset performance and changes in regulatory or accounting requirements Based upon factors known and considered as of December 31 2017 the Company does not anticipate making significant cash contributions to the pension plans in 2018.The investment target portfolio allocation for the Company-sponsored pension plans and supplemental pension plan focuses primarily on corporate fixed income securities that match the overall duration and term of the Company s pension liability structure Refer to Retirement Plans  within Critical Accounting Policies and Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding other plan assumptions.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWith the exception of operating lease financing on certain equipment used in the operation of the business it is not the Company s general practice to use off-balance sheet arrangements such as third-party special-purpose entities or guarantees of third parties.Critical Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts that are based on management s estimates judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period The following is a description of the Company s accounting policies that management believes require the most significant judgments and estimates when preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements:Revenue Recognition Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the earnings process is complete and when the title and risk and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer which is primarily at the time of shipment Revenue recognized other than at time of shipment represented less than 1 of the Company s consolidated net sales in the periods ended September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor and the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Revenue from shipping and handling charges is recorded in net sales Provisions for allowances related to sales discounts and rebates are recorded based on terms of the sale in the period that the sale is recorded Management utilizes historical information and the current sales trends of the business to estimate such provisions Actual results could differ from these estimates The provisions related to discounts and rebates due to customers are recorded as a reduction within net sales in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Income.The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts related to the potential inability of our customers to make required payments The allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level considered appropriate based on historical experience and specific identification of customer receivable balances for which collection is unlikely The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded in sales general and administrative expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Income Estimates of doubtful accounts are based on historical write-off experience as a percentage of net sales and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers which can fluctuate significantly from year to year The Company cannot be certain that the rate of future credit losses will be similar to past experience.The Company also maintains an allowance for credit memos for estimated credit memos to be issued against current sales Estimates of allowance for credit memos are based upon the application of a historical issuance lag period to the average credit memos issued each month If actual results differ significantly from historical experience there could be a negative impact on the Company s operating results.Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets to assess whether it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized and if necessary establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets to reduce the carrying value 32For purposes of assessing whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets will be realized the Company considers the following four sources of taxable income for each tax jurisdiction a future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences b projected future earnings c taxable income in carryback years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under the tax laws of the applicable jurisdiction and d tax planning strategies which represent prudent and feasible actions that a company ordinarily might not take but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused To the extent that evidence about one or more of these sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary other sources need not be considered Otherwise evidence about each of the sources of taxable income is considered in arriving at a conclusion about the need for and amount of a valuation allowance See Note 13 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company's valuation allowance assessments The Company has incurred significant losses in recent years The Company s operations in the United States United Kingdom and Canada have generated pre-tax losses for the three-year period ended December 31 2017 As a result of the Company having recorded deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions as December 31 2017 and 2016 coupled with the negative evidence of significant cumulative three-year pre-tax losses the Company has provided a valuation allowance against the full net deferred tax asset balances recorded in United Kingdom and Canada and certain of the deferred income tax assets recorded by the United States operations at December 31 2017 The Company is subject to taxation in the United States various states and foreign jurisdictions Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related income tax assets and liabilities It is possible that actual results could differ from the estimates that management has used to determine its consolidated income tax expense.The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes by recognizing the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more-likely-than-not sustain the position following an audit For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not criteria the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority Retirement Plans The Company values retirement plan liabilities based on assumptions and valuations established by management Future valuations are subject to market changes which are not in the control of the Company and could differ materially from the amounts currently reported The Company evaluates the discount rate and expected return on assets at least annually and evaluates other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age mortality and turnover periodically and updates them to reflect actual experience and expectations for the future Actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.Accumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments which are discounted using the weighted average of market-observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent-year pension expense higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent-year pension expense Discount rates used for determining the Company s projected benefit obligation for its pension plans were 3.51 3.58 at December 31 2017 Successor 3.52 3.62 at August 31 2017 Predecessor and 3.70 3.83 at December 31 2016 Predecessor The Company s pension plan asset portfolio as of December 31 2017 Successor is primarily invested in fixed income securities with a duration of approximately 12 years The assets generally fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy Assets in the Company s pension plans have earned approximately 9 since 2008 when the Company changed its target investment allocation to focus primarily on fixed income securities In 2017 the pension plan assets earned approximately 10 The target investment asset allocation for the pension plans  funds focuses primarily on corporate fixed income securities that match the overall duration and term of the Company s pension liability structure There was a funding surplus of approximately 3 at December 31 2017 Successor compared to a funding deficit of 2 at December 31 2016 Predecessor To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the pension plans  assets current and expected asset allocations are considered as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 33The Company used the following weighted average discount rates and expected return on plan assets to determine the net periodic pension cost Successor Predecessor September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Year Ended

point decrease in discount rate$0.450 basis point increase in discount rate(0.3)50 basis point decrease in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets0.8Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value The net realizable value of metals is subject to volatility During periods when open-market prices decline below net book value we may need to record a provision to reduce the carrying value of our inventory We analyze the carrying value of inventory for impairment if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred If impairment occurs the amount of impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying value of inventory over the net realizable value of inventory The Company maintains an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory The excess and obsolete inventory allowance is determined through the specific identification of material adjusted for expected scrap value to be received based upon product knowledge estimated future demand market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand Inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value Although the Company believes its estimates of the inventory allowance are reasonable actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates Changes in assumptions around the estimated future demand selling price scrap value a decision to reduce inventories to increase liquidity or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the carrying value of inventory future inventory impairment charges or both Long-Lived Assets The Company s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If future net cash flows are less than the carrying value the asset or asset group may be impaired If such assets are impaired the impairment charge is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset s residual value if any The Company derives the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from historical experience and internal business plans The Company had no impairments of long-lived assets in the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor or the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor 34Fair Value of Financial Instruments The three-tier value hierarchy the Company utilizes which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies is:Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.The fair value of cash accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values The fair value of cash equivalents are determined using the fair value hierarchy described above The Company s pension plan asset portfolio as of December 31 2017 Successor and December 31 2016 Predecessor is primarily invested in fixed income securities which generally fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy Fixed income securities are valued based on evaluated prices provided to the trustee by independent pricing services Such prices may be determined by factors which include but are not limited to market quotations yields maturities call features ratings institutional size trading in similar groups of securities and developments related to specific securities The fair value of the Second Lien Notes including the bifurcated embedded conversion option falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and was determined based on market information and a review of prices and terms available for similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature as well as other factors related to the callable nature of the Second Lien Notes The main inputs and assumptions into the fair value model for the Second Lien Notes at December 31 2017 Successor were as follows:Risk-free interest rate2.16%Credit spreads13.93%PIK premium spread2.00%Volatility50.00%Given the nature and the variable interest rates the fair value of borrowings under the New ABL Facility and the French subsidiary's foreign line of credit approximated the carrying value at December 31 2017 Successor Recent Accounting PronouncementsSee Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements for detailed

intangible assets the valuation of deferred income taxes the fair value of the Company's Second Lien Notes including the conversion option pension and other post-employment benefits and share-based compensation.Revenue recognition Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the earnings process is complete and when the title and risk and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer which is primarily at the time of shipment Revenue recognized other than at the time of shipment represented less than 1 of the Company s consolidated net sales in the periods ended September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor and the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Provisions for allowances related to sales discounts and

appropriate based on historical experience and specific identification of customer receivable balances for which collection is unlikely The provision for doubtful accounts is recorded in sales general and administrative expense in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Income Estimates of doubtful accounts are based on historical write-off experience as a percentage of net sales and judgments about the probable effects of economic conditions on certain customers.The Company also maintains an allowance for credit memos for estimated credit memos to be issued against current sales Estimates of allowance for credit memos are based upon the application of a historical issuance lag period to the average credit memos issued each month.Accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts and credit memos activity is presented in the table below Successor Predecessor September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 January 1 2017 through August 31

inventory The excess and obsolete inventory allowance is determined through the specific identification of material adjusted for expected scrap value to be received based on previous sales experience.Excess and obsolete inventory allowance activity is presented in the table below Successor Predecessor September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Year

of period$1,680  7,877Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment are stated at cost and include assets held under capital leases Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs that do not substantially improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are expensed in the period in which they are incurred When items are disposed the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income In connection with the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting on the Effective Date the Company made adjustments to increase the carrying value of certain property plant and equipment to their estimated fair value The Company s overall range of useful lives from an accounting policy perspective did not change However when the fair 43value of each asset was adjusted a new remaining useful life was assigned to each asset and the new value will be depreciated over that time period which may be different from the remaining depreciable life of that asset at the end of the Predecessor period.The Company provides for depreciation of plant and equipment sufficient to amortize the cost over their estimated useful lives as follows Successor PredecessorBuildings and building improvements5 40 years 5 40 yearsPlant equipment5 20 years 5 20 yearsFurniture and fixtures2 10 years 2 10 yearsVehicles and office equipment3 10 years 3 10 yearsLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the remaining term of the lease Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method and depreciation expense in the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor was 3,213 and 6,062 respectively and 10,252 in the year ended December 31 2016 Predecessor Long-lived assets The Company s long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to be generated by the asset or asset group If future net cash flows are less than the carrying value the asset or asset group may be impaired If such assets are impaired the impairment charge is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets Determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which undiscounted cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the asset s residual value if any The Company derives the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from historical experience and internal business plans.Goodwill and intangible assets In connection with the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting on the Effective Date the Company recorded 2,675 of goodwill representing the excess of reorganization value over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets The Company currently has one reporting unit The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at December 1 of each year or more frequently if a significant event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value The Company assesses at least quarterly whether any events or circumstances have significantly changed which may imply that the carrying amount of its reporting unit's goodwill is impaired.The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions to be made by management The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of an income approach which estimates fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis using historical data estimates of future cash flows and discount rates based on the view of a market participant and a market approach which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures of comparable public companies In selecting the appropriate assumptions the Company considers the following the selection of appropriate peer group companies control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industry in which the Company competes discount rates terminal growth rates long-term projections of future financial performance and relative weighting of income and market approaches The long-term projections used in the valuation are developed as part of the Company s annual long-term planning process The discount rates used to determine the fair values of the reporting unit is that of a hypothetical market participant which are developed based upon an analysis of comparable companies and include adjustments made to account for any individual reporting unit specific attributes such as size and industry.The majority of the Predecessor Company s recorded intangible assets as of December 31 2016 were acquired as part of the Transtar acquisition in September 2006 and consist of customer relationships amortized over their useful lives of 4 to 12 years In connection with the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting on the Effective Date an insignificant amount of the Predecessor's intangible assets and related accumulated amortization were eliminated Also as part of fresh-start accounting the Company recorded an adjustment of 5,500 representing the fair value of the intangible asset of the Successor refer to Note 2 Bankruptcy Related Disclosures The intangible asset of the Successor is comprised of an indefinite-lived trade name which is not subject to amortization The fair value of the Successor trade name intangible asset was determined based on the relief from royalty method which estimates the 44savings that the owner of the asset would realize rather than paying a royalty to use the asset using forecasted net sales attributable to the trade name and applying a royalty rate assumed to be 0.1 to those net sales The Company s indefinite-lived intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis on December 1 of each year or more frequently if significant events or changes in circumstances occur which may indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable as measured by comparing carrying value to the estimated future cash flows generated by its use An impaired asset is recorded at estimated fair value determined principally using an income-based approach similar to the relief from royalty method used in the initial valuation of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with the excess amount of carrying value over the fair value representing the amount of the impairment Assumptions used in the income-based approach including projected revenues and assumed royalty rate long-term growth and discount rates Income taxes The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements Under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amounts will not be realized In making such a determination the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax-planning strategies and recent results of operations In the event the Company determines it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is recorded which increases the provision for income taxes in the period in which that determination is made.During 2017 the Company's foreign assets remained pledged as collateral for certain borrowings This continues to result in a taxable income inclusion in the U.S of the annual earnings generated by its foreign subsidiaries As a result of the Tax Act see Note 13 Income Taxes and this pledge of foreign assets there are no remaining undistributed earnings which have not been subject to U.S income taxation as of December 31 2017 Successor on which the Company would need to record any additional U.S deferred tax liability For uncertain tax positions if any the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance which requires application of a more likely than not  threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions The Company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the Company s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results As of December 31 2017 Successor the Company has no uncertain tax positions for which a tax or interest reserve has been recognized.The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits if any within income tax expense Accrued interest and penalties are included within other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets As of December 31 2017 Successor the Company has accrued no interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.During the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor the Company recorded a net tax benefit based on currently available information and interpretations of applying the provisions of the 2017 U.S Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Tax Act as of the time of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin SAB No 118 issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC the

known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2017 SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740 In accordance with SAB 118 a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete To the extent that a company s accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete but it is able to determine a reasonable estimate it must record a provisional estimate in the financial statements During the period September 451 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor the Company recorded a net tax benefit based on currently available information

Assets and liabilities of those operations are translated into U.S dollars using year-end exchange rates and income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period The currency effects of translating financial statements of the Company s non-U.S operations which operate in local currency environments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss a separate component of stockholders  deficit equity Transaction gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been primarily related to unhedged intercompany financing

of shares of common stock plus outstanding common stock equivalents Common stock equivalents consist of employee and director stock options Predecessor restricted stock awards Predecessor and Successor other share-based payment awards Predecessor and contingently issuable shares related to the Company s New Convertible Notes Predecessor and the Company's Second Lien Notes Successor which

greater than 3.77 per share which is the conversion price of the Second Lien Notes Under the if-converted method the Second Lien Notes are only dilutive for the in the money  portion of the Second Lien Notes that could be settled with the Company s stock In future periods absent a fundamental change as defined in the Second Lien Notes indenture the outstanding Second Lien Notes could increase diluted average shares outstanding by a maximum of approximately 43,700 shares Concentrations The Company serves a wide range of customers within the producer durable equipment aerospace heavy industrial equipment industrial goods construction equipment retail marine and automotive sectors of the economy Its customer base includes many Fortune 500 companies as well as thousands of medium and smaller sized firms spread across the entire spectrum of metals-using industries The Company s customer base is well diversified and therefore the Company does not have dependence upon any single customer or a few customers No single customer represented more than 5 of the Company s total net sales in either the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor or January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor Approximately 65 and 63 of the Company s net sales in the periods September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor and January 1 2017 through August 31 2017 Predecessor respectively were from locations in the United States.Share-based compensation Pursuant to the Plan on the Effective Date all prior director officer and employee management incentive share-based compensation plans as well as the unvested/unexercised awards issued thereunder were extinguished without recovery Also on the Effective Date the new A.M Castle Co 2017 47Management Incentive Plan the MIP under which persons eligible to receive awards include directors officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries became effective The types of awards that may be granted under the MIP include stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units performance units performance shares and other forms of cash or stock based awards Pursuant to the Plan on September 1 2017 1,734 shares together with an aggregate original principal amount of 2,400 of Second Lien Notes the Restricted Notes convertible into an additional 638 shares of New Common Stock as of the Effective Date were issued as awards of restricted shares of the Company's common stock the Restricted Shares under the MIP to certain officers of the Company The Restricted Shares and Restricted Notes cliff vest on August 31 2020 subject to the conditions set forth in the MIP The Restricted Shares grant date fair value of 3.14 per share was based on the value of the common stock of the Successor company as calculated on the Effective date pursuant to the Plan Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the estimated grant date fair value of the Restricted Shares and Restricted Notes respectively The Company may either issue from treasury or new shares upon award vesting In connection with the adoption of fresh-start accounting the Company elected to make an accounting policy change related to the accounting for stock-based compensation The Predecessor estimated the level of forfeitures expected to occur at the time of each grant and recorded compensation expense only for those stock-based awards that it ultimately expected would vest The estimate was based on the Company's historical rates of forfeitures and was updated periodically The Successor has elected to no longer estimate the number of stock-based awards expected to vest but rather will account for forfeitures as they occur New Accounting Standards Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsEffective January 1 2017 the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU No 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions Under ASU No 2016-09 a company recognizes all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement eliminating the notion of the additional paid-in capital pool and significantly reducing the complexity and cost of accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies This aspect of the guidance is required to be applied prospectively For interim reporting purposes excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are considered discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur and are not included in the estimate of an entity s annual effective tax rate ASU No 2016-09 further eliminates the requirement to defer recognition of an excess tax benefit until the benefit is realized through a reduction to taxes payable Upon adoption the Company elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period The adoption of ASU No 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements As described above upon emergence from bankruptcy the Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements Recently Issued Account Standards Not Yet Effective In March 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-07 Compensation Retirement Benefits Topic 715 Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost Under the new guidance employers must present the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item(s as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period In addition only the service cost component will be eligible for capitalization in assets The other components of net periodic benefit cost must be reported separately from the line item(s that includes the service cost component and outside of any subtotal of operating income if one is presented Employers will have to disclose the line(s used to present the other components of net periodic benefit cost if the components are not presented separately in the income statement The guidance on the income statement presentation of the components of net periodic benefit cost must be applied retrospectively while the guidance limiting the capitalization of net periodic benefit cost in assets to the service cost component must be applied prospectively For public business entities the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2017 and interim periods within those years The Company adopted ASU 2017-07 on January 1 2018 and concluded it will have an insignificant impact on its loss income before income taxes The Company is currently assessing the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on the presentation of its statement of operations and comprehensive loss income In January 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-04 Intangibles Goodwill and Other Topic 350 which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and interim impairment tests beginning January 1 2020 for the Company and is required to be 48adopted using a prospective approach Early adoption is allowed for annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1 2017 Unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value the Company's annual goodwill impairment testing will next occur on December 1 2018 The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures In August 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows Topic 230 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments to reduce the existing diversity in practice related to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230 The amendments in ASU No 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230 The provisions of ASU No 2016-15 must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented with limited exceptions For public companies the amendments in ASU No 2016-15 were effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2017 and interim periods within those years The Company adopted ASU No 2016-15 on January 1 2018 and will comply with the presentation and statement of cash flows classification guidance going forward In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU No 2016-02 Leases Topic 842 which requires that lessees recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position ASU No 2016-02 also requires additional disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases The provisions of ASU No 2016-02 are to be applied using a modified retrospective approach and are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15 2018 including interim reporting periods within that reporting period Early adoption is permitted The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of ASU No 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements but the Company expects that most existing operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease obligations and right-of-use assets as a result of adoption.In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU No 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606 and has subsequently issued several supplemental and/or clarifying ASUs collectively ASC 606 The underlying principle of ASC 606 is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in prior accounting guidance Adoption of ASC 606 was required for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15 2017 Almost all of the Company s purchase orders contracts or purchase agreements do not contain performance obligations other than delivery of the agreed upon product with title transfer generally occurring at the time of shipment Thus the Company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of the product Based on the Company's analysis of all of its revenue generating activities and the contracts which might impact its revenue generating activities in light of the new standard the Company has concluded that the timing and amount of revenue recognized under ASC 606 is consistent with the revenue recognition policy under the previous guidance and none of its revenue streams are materially affected by the adoption of ASC 606 The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method and will expand its consolidated financial statement disclosures in order to comply with the ASU 2 Bankruptcy Related DisclosuresChapter 11 Bankruptcy FilingOn the Petition Date the Debtors filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions for reorganization under

Company and its subsidiaries became effective Reporting During BankruptcyDuring the pendency of the Company's chapter 11 cases expenses and income directly associated with the chapter 11 proceedings were reported separately in reorganization items net in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss Income Reorganization items net also include adjustments to reflect the carrying value of liabilities subject to compromise LSTC at their estimated allowed claim amounts as such adjustments were determined In addition effective as of the Petition Date and during the pendency of the Company's chapter 11 cases the Company discontinued recording interest expense on outstanding prepetition debt classified as LSTC Upon the Company's emergence from its chapter 11 cases the Company settled and extinguished or reinstated liabilities that were subject to compromise.Fresh-Start AccountingUnder ASC No 852 Reorganizations fresh-start accounting is required upon emergence from chapter 11 if i the reorganization value of the assets of the emerging entity immediately before the date of confirmation is less than the total of all post-petition liabilities and allowed claims and ii holders of existing voting shares immediately before confirmation receive less than 50 of the voting shares of the emerging entity The Company qualified for and adopted fresh-start accounting as of the Effective Date Adopting fresh-start accounting results in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or deficits The cancellation of all existing common shares outstanding on the Effective Date and issuance of new shares of the reorganized entity resulted in a change of control of the Company under ASC No 852 Reorganizations Adoption of fresh-start accounting resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes and the recording of the Company s assets and liabilities at their fair value as of the Effective Date with the excess of reorganization value over net asset values recorded as goodwill in conformity with ASC No 805 Business Combinations The estimated fair values of the Company s assets and liabilities as of that date differed from the recorded values of its assets and liabilities as reflected in its historical consolidated financial statements In addition 51the Company s adoption of fresh-start accounting affected its results of operations following the fresh-start reporting date as the Company had a new basis in its assets and liabilities The Company also adopted one new accounting policy in connection with its adoption of fresh-start accounting see Note 1 Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Consequently the Company s financial statements on or after the Effective Date are not comparable with the financial statements prior to that date and the historical financial statements before the Effective Date are not reliable indicators of its financial condition and results of operations for any period after it adopted fresh-start accounting.Reorganization ValueReorganization value is the value attributed to an entity emerging from bankruptcy as well as the expected net realizable value of those assets that will be disposed before emergence occurs This value is viewed as the value of the entity before considering liabilities and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after emergence Fresh-start accounting requires that the reporting entity allocate the reorganization value to its assets and liabilities in relation to their fair values upon emergence from chapter 11 with the excess of reorganization value over net asset values recorded as goodwill The Company s valuation of the reorganized Company which was included in the Disclosure Statement related to the Plan estimated the enterprise value of the Company to be in a range between 234 million and 264 million The Company estimated the enterprise value of the Successor Company to be 244 million The estimated enterprise value and the equity value are highly dependent on the achievement of the future financial results contemplated in the projections that were set forth in the Plan The estimates and assumptions made in the valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainties The primary assumptions for which there is a reasonable possibility of the occurrence of a variation that would have significantly affected the reorganization value include the assumptions regarding revenue growth operating expenses the amount and timing of capital expenditures and the discount rate utilized.In order to determine the reorganization value the Company estimated the enterprise value of the Successor utilizing the discounted cash flow analysis To estimate the fair value utilizing the discounted cash flow analysis the Company established an estimate of future cash flows for the period from August 31 2017 to December 31 2021 and discounted the estimated future cash flows to the present value adding the present value of the terminal value of cash flows beyond December 31 2021 The expected cash flows for the period August 31 2017 to December 31 2021 were derived from earnings forecasts and assumptions regarding growth and margin projections and adjusted for other cash flows including capital expenditures and charges to working capital as applicable and expressed as a multiple of Earnings before Interest Taxes Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA The discount rate of 11.1 was estimated based on an after-tax weighted average cost of capital reflecting the rate of return that would be expected by a market participant The following table reconciles the Company's enterprise value to the estimated fair value of the Successor's equity as of the Effective Date:Enterprise value $244,000Less fair value of debt (238,340)Equity value $5,660The fair value of the convertible notes portion of the debt was determined based on market information and a review of prices and terms available for similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature as well as other factors related to the callable nature of the convertible notes Given the nature and the variable interest rates the fair value of borrowings under the asset-based lending facility approximated carrying value as of the Effective Date.52The following table reconciles the Company's enterprise value to the reorganization value of the Successor's assets Enterprise value$244,000Current liabilities excluding short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt)61,169Noncurrent liabilities excluding long-term debt)23,479Reorganization value of Successor assets$328,648The total of all postpetition liabilities and allowed claims immediately prior to confirmation of the Plan was approximately 404 million.Fresh-Start Balance SheetThe following fresh-start balance sheet as of the Effective Date August 31 2017 illustrates the financial effects on the Company of the implementation of the Plan and the adoption of fresh-start reporting This fresh-start balance sheet reflects the effect of the completion of the transactions included in the Plan including the issuance of successor equity and the settlement of prepetition indebtedness Reorganization adjustments shown in column 2 of the following schedule

their estimated fair value The Company s overall range of useful lives from an accounting policy perspective did not change However when the fair value of each asset was adjusted a new remaining useful life was assigned to each asset and the new value will be depreciated over that time period which may be different from the remaining depreciable life of that asset at the end of the Predecessor period Estimated fair value was determined as follows The cost approach was utilized to estimate the fair value of personal property as well as buildings and land improvements This approach considers the amount required to construct or purchase a new asset of equal utility at current market prices with adjustments in value for physical deterioration The sales comparison approach was utilized to estimate fair value of owned real property The sales comparison approach relies upon recent sales offerings of similar assets or a specific inflationary adjustment to original purchase

joint venture of the Company In June 2016 the Company received an offer from its joint venture partner to purchase its ownership share in Kreher for an amount that was less than the current carrying value of the Company's investment in Kreher The Company determined that the offer to purchase its ownership share in Kreher at a purchase price lower than the carrying value indicated that it may not be able to recover the full carrying amount of its investment and therefore recognized a 4,636 other-than-temporary impairment charge in the second quarter of 2016 to reduce the carrying amount of the investment to the negotiated purchase price Prior to receiving the purchase offer the Company had no previous indicators that its investment in Kreher had incurred a loss in value that was other-than-temporary In August 2016 the Company completed the sale of its ownership share in Kreher to its joint venture partner for aggregate cash proceeds of 31,550 which resulted in a loss on

2,400 of restricted Second Lien Notes issued to certain members of management see Note 10 Share-based compensation The Second Lien Notes are five year senior obligations of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries secured by a lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the Company its domestic subsidiaries and certain of its foreign subsidiaries which lien the Indenture Agent has agreed will be junior to the lien of the Agent under the New ABL Facility As further described below the Second Lien Notes are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder Upon conversion the Company will pay and/or deliver as the case may be cash shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock at the Company s election together with cash in lieu of fractional shares The Company determined that upon issuance the conversion option was not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the Second Lien Notes nor did it meet the criteria to be considered indexed to the Company s common stock As a result the Company concluded that the embedded conversion option must be bifurcated from the Second Lien Notes separately valued and marked-to-market through earnings in each subsequent reporting period Prior to December 31 2017 the embedded conversion option was classified in long-term debt.On December 31 2017 changes in the Company's governance were resolved that resulted in the conversion option meeting the criteria to be considered indexed to the Company s common stock effective December 31 2017 Accordingly the conversion option was no longer required to be recognized as a bifurcated embedded derivative with 59changes in its fair value marked-to-market through earnings On this date the previously bifurcated embedded conversion option was remeasured to a fair value of 60,760 and reclassified from a liability to additional paid-in capital The deferred tax asset of 17,044 associated

to adjustment as set forth in the Second Lien Notes Indenture The value of shares of the Company s common stock for purposes of the settlement of the conversion right will be calculated as provided in the Second Lien Notes Indenture using a 20 trading day observation period Upon conversion the Company will pay and/or deliver as the case may be cash shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock at the Company s election together with cash in lieu of fractional shares Under the Second Lien Notes Indenture in a conversion of the Second Lien Notes in connection with a Fundamental Change  as defined in the Second Lien Notes Indenture for each 1.00 principal amount of the Second Lien Notes that number of shares of the Company s common stock issuable upon conversion shall equal the greater of a 1.00 divided by the then applicable conversion price and b 1.00 divided by the stock price with respect to such Fundamental Change

liquidation or dissolution of the Company by the Company s stockholders.The Second Lien Notes are guaranteed jointly and severally by certain subsidiaries of the Company The Second Lien Notes and the related guarantees are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company s and the guarantors  assets subject to certain exceptions pursuant to certain collateral documents pursuant to the Second Lien Notes Indenture The terms of the Second Lien Notes contain numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on the Company s business These covenants place restrictions on the Company s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to among other things pay dividends redeem stock or make other distributions or restricted payments incur indebtedness or issue certain stock make certain investments create liens agree to certain payment restrictions affecting certain subsidiaries sell or otherwise transfer or dispose assets enter into transactions with affiliates and enter

Indenture In addition if a Fundamental Change occurs at any time each holder of any Second Lien Notes has the right to require the Company to repurchase such holder s Second Lien Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount thereof together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon subject to certain exceptions The Company must use the excess proceeds of material sales of collateral to make an offer of repurchase to holders of the Second Lien Notes Indebtedness for borrowings under the Second Lien Notes Indenture is subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified defaults or events of default including failure to pay principal or interest the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of any obligor under the Second Lien Notes failure by an obligor

bankruptcy-related and other events Interest on the Second Lien Notes accrues at the rate of 5.00 except that the Company may in circumstances where the payment on interest in cash would cause a condition of default under the New ABL Facility pay at the rate of 7.00 in kind Currently the Company is paying interest on the Second Lien Notes in kind at a rate of 7.00 as required in the first 12 months per the Second Lien Notes Indenture Interest expense of 3,865 was paid in kind for the period September 1 2017 through December 31 2017 Successor Short-term borrowingsIn July 2017 the Company's

cash needs As of December 31 2017 Successor the French subsidiary has borrowings of 5,854 under the credit facility 7 Fair Value MeasurementsThe three-tier value hierarchy the Company utilizes which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies is:Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level 2 Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level 3 Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.The fair value of cash accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values The fair value of cash equivalents are determined using the fair value hierarchy described above The Company s pension plan asset portfolio as of December 31 2017 Successor and December 31 2016 Predecessor is primarily invested in fixed income securities which generally fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy Fixed income securities in the pension plan asset portfolio are valued based on evaluated prices provided to the trustee by independent pricing services Such prices may be determined by factors which include but are not limited to market quotations yields maturities call features ratings institutional size trading in similar groups of securities and developments related to specific securities Refer to Note 11 Employee Benefit Plans for pension fair value disclosures.Fair Value Measurements of DebtAs of December 31 2017 Successor the fair value of the Company's Second Lien Notes including the conversion option was estimated to be 159,042 compared to a carrying value of 166,623 The fair values for the Second Lien Notes including the conversion option falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and was determined based on market information and a review of prices and terms available for similar debt instruments that do not contain a conversion feature as well as other factors related to the callable nature of the Second Lien Notes The main inputs and assumptions into the fair value model for the Second Lien Notes at December 31 2017 Successor were as follows:Risk-free interest rate2.16%Credit spreads13.93%PIK premium spread2.00%Volatility50.00%Given the nature and the variable interest rates the fair value of borrowings under the New ABL Facility and the French subsidiary's foreign line of credit approximated the carrying value at December 31 2017 Successor Fair Value Measurements of Embedded Conversion FeatureThe estimated fair value of the conversion option of the Second Lien Notes reclassified from a derivative liability classified as long-term debt to additional paid-in capital on December 31 2017 Successor was estimated to be 60,760 as of that date see Note 6 Debt The estimated fair value of the conversion option of the Second Lien Notes which falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was measured on a recurring basis using a binomial lattice model using the Company's historical volatility over the term corresponding to the remaining contractual term of the Second Lien Notes and observed spreads of similar debt instruments that do not include a conversion feature Effective with the reclassification of the conversion option from debt to additional paid-in capital on December 31 2017 Successor the conversion option will no longer be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 61Prior to December 31 2017 the conversion option was recognized as a derivative liability classified as long-term debt with changes in its fair value marked-to-market through earnings The following reconciliation represents the change in fair value of the conversion option of the Second Lien Notes between December 31 2016 Predecessor and December 31 2017 Successor prior to its reclassification to additional paid-in capital Derivative liability for embedded

of time as the basis for all rental payments.The Company has determined that for accounting purposes its lease of its operating facility in Janesville Wisconsin is a build-to-suit lease During the construction of this facility which concluded in the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company assumed certain risks of certain construction cost overages and was therefore deemed to be the owner of the facility during the construction period All costs of construction related to this facility are recognized as property plant and equipment with a related build-to-suit liability.Subsequent to the completion of construction the Company did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting because of provisions in the lease which constituted prohibited continuing involvement As a result the Company will amortize the build-to-suit liability over the lease term and depreciate the building over the lease term The Company has reflected 10,148 and 12,305 as build-to-suit liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 2017 Successor and December 31 2016 Predecessor respectively.Total gross value of property plant and equipment under capital leases was 360 and 524 as of December 31
