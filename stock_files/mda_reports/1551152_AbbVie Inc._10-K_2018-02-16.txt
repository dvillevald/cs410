products highly competitive AbbVie competes research-based pharmaceuticals biotechnology companies discover manufacture market sell proprietary pharmaceutical products biologics For example HUMIRA competes anti-TNF products competitive products intended treat number disease states AbbVie's virology products compete available HCV treatment options The search technological innovations pharmaceutical products significant aspect competition The introduction new products competitors changes medical practices procedures result product obsolescence Price also competitive factor In addition substitution generic pharmaceutical products branded pharmaceutical products creates competitive pressures AbbVie's products patent protection New products treatments brought market AbbVie competitors could cause revenues AbbVie products decrease due price reductions sales volume decreases Biosimilars Competition AbbVie biologic products affected approval follow-on biologics also known biosimilars Biologics added major therapeutic options treatment many diseases including therapies unavailable inadequate The advent biologics also raised complex regulatory issues significant pharmacoeconomic concerns cost developing producing biologic therapies typically dramatically higher conventional small molecule medications many expensive biologic medications used ongoing treatment chronic diseases rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease treatment previously untreatable cancer Significant investments biologics infrastructure manufacturing necessary produce biologic products significant investments marketing distribution sales organization activities may limit number biosimilar competitors.In United States FDA regulates biologics Federal Food Drug Cosmetic Act Public Health Service Act implementing regulations The enactment federal health care reform legislation March 2010 provided pathway approval biosimilars Public Health Service Act approval process science behind biosimilars complex approval process science behind generic follow-on versions small molecule products This added complexity due steps needed ensure safety efficacy biosimilars highly similar original biologic HUMIRA Ultimate approval FDA dependent upon many factors including showing biosimilar highly similar original product clinically meaningful differences original product terms safety purity potency The types data could ordinarily required application show similarity may include analytical data studies demonstrate chemical similarity animal studies including toxicity studies clinical studies The law also requires biosimilar must condition use approved original biologic manufacturing facility meets standards necessary assure biosimilar safe pure potent.Furthermore law provides biosimilar product determined interchangeable considered substitutable original biologic product without intervention health care provider prescribed original biologic product To prove biosimilar product interchangeable applicant must demonstrate product expected produce clinical results original biologic product given patient product administered patient safety risks potential
