of Contents Excluding the impact of foreign exchange net sales growth in 2018 was driven by growth in all of Abbott s business segments and the acquisition of Alere Inc Alere which closed in the fourth quarter of 2017 The increase in the Other category reflects growth in Abbott s Diabetes Care business partially offset by the sale of the Abbott Medical Optics AMO business to Johnson  Johnson The AMO business was included in Abbott s results as a non-reportable segment through February 27 2017 the date of the divestiture Double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was led by FreeStyle  Libre Abbott s sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring CGM system which removes the need for routine fingersticks for people with diabetes Excluding the impact of the Alere acquisition the divestitures of AMO and the legacy St Jude Medical vascular closure business and the impact of foreign exchange total net sales increased 8.0 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and 7.5 percent in the first six months of 2018 respectively Sales related to these divestitures totaled 187 million in the first six months of 2017 Abbott s net sales were also positively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period compared to 2017 The relatively weaker U.S dollar increased total international sales by 2.6 percent and total sales by 1.7 percent in the second quarter of 2018 The relatively weaker U.S dollar increased total international sales by 4.5 percent and total sales by 2.8 percent in the first six months of 2018 The table below provides detail by sales category for the

Markets for the Established Pharmaceutical Products business include India Russia Brazil and China along with several other markets that represent the most attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott s branded generics product portfolio Sales in the Key Emerging Markets increased 9.5 percent compared to the first six months of 2017 excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange due to double-digit growth across several geographies including India and China The 7.2 percent increase in International Pediatric Nutritional sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange was primarily driven by strong growth across several countries in Asia including Greater China In the U.S the 2.9 percent increase in Pediatric Nutritional sales reflects higher Pedialyte consumption and market share gains in the infant nutrition category The 9.3 percent increase in International Adult Nutritional sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange reflects continued strong growth of the Ensure  and Glucerna  brands in Asia and Latin America In the U.S the 1.6 percent increase in Adult Nutritional sales was driven by the growth of Ensure products The 49.0 percent increase in Diagnostics sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange was primarily driven by Alere which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017 Excluding the impact of the acquisition as well as the impact of foreign exchange sales in Diagnostics increased 6.1 percent driven primarily by share gains in Core Laboratory in the U.S and internationally 24 Table of Contents The 5.0 percent increase in Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products sales excluding the effect of foreign exchange was driven by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology Neuromodulation and Structural Heart The growth in Electrophysiology reflects strong performance in cardiac mapping and ablation as well as share gains from the recent U.S launch of Abbott s Confirm RxTM Insertable Cardiac Monitor ICM the world s first and only smartphone-compatible ICM designed to help physicians remotely identify cardiac arrhythmias In May 2018 Abbott announced U.S FDA clearance of the AdvisorTM HD Grid Mapping Catheter Sensor EnabledTM which creates detailed maps of the heart and expands Abbott s electrophysiology product portfolio The growth in Neuromodulation reflects higher revenue for various products for the treatment of chronic pain and movement disorders Growth in Structural Heart was driven by several product areas including the AMPLATZERTM PFO Occluder and MitraClip  Abbott s market-leading device for the minimally-invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation In July Abbott announced U.S FDA approval for a next-generation version of MitraClip In Heart Failure sales growth was led by higher international sales In Vascular higher international drug eluting stent DES sales and growth in vessel closure and other revenues offset lower U.S DES sales due to lower market share During the second quarter Abbott received approval from the U.S FDA for XIENCETM Sierra the newest generation of its coronary stent system During the second quarter XIENCE Sierra also received national reimbursement in Japan to treat people with coronary artery disease In Rhythm Management market share gains in the new patient segment were offset by replacement cycle dynamics The gross profit margin percentage was 50.5 percent for the second quarter of 2018 compared to 46.0 percent for the second quarter of 2017 The gross profit margin percentage was 50.6 percent for the first six months of 2018 compared to 44.8 percent for the first six months of 2017 The increase primarily reflects the favorable comparison versus the prior year which included inventory step-up amortization related to the St Jude Medical acquisition The increase also reflects margin improvement in various businesses including Diabetes Care and Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Research and development expenses increased by 55 million or 10.5 percent in the second quarter of 2018 and increased by 91 million or 8.4 percent in the first six months of 2018 due primarily to the addition of the acquired Alere business as well as higher spending in other areas including Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation For the six months ended June 30 2018 research and development expenditures totaled 508 million for the Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation Products segment 293 million for the Diagnostic Products segment 98 million for the Nutritional Products segment and 92 million for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment Selling general and administrative expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 increased 14.7 percent and 9.1 percent respectively due primarily to the addition of the acquired Alere business as well as higher spending to drive continued growth and market expansion in various businesses partially offset by lower acquisition-related expenses In the first quarter of 2018 Abbott retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update ASU 2017-07 Compensation Retirement Benefits Topic 715 Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost which changes the financial statement presentation requirements for pension and other postretirement benefit expense While service cost continues to be reported in the same financial statement line items as other current employee compensation costs the ASU requires all other components of pension and other postretirement benefit cost to be presented separately from service cost and outside any subtotal of income from operations As a result of the new accounting standard approximately 80 million of pension and other post retirement related income is now being reported in Other income expense net in the first six months of 2018 and 2017 Business Acquisitions On January 4 2017 Abbott completed the acquisition of St Jude Medical a global medical device manufacturer for approximately 23.6 billion including approximately 13.6 billion in cash and approximately 10 billion in Abbott common shares which represented approximately 254 million shares of Abbott common stock based on Abbott s closing stock price on the acquisition date As part of the acquisition approximately 5.9 billion of St Jude Medical s debt was assumed repaid or refinanced by Abbott The acquisition provides expanded opportunities for future growth and is an important part of the company s ongoing effort to develop a strong diverse portfolio of devices diagnostics nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals The combined business competes in nearly every area of the cardiovascular device market as well as in the neuromodulation market Under the terms of the agreement for each St Jude Medical common share St Jude Medical shareholders received 46.75 in cash and 0.8708 of an Abbott common share At an Abbott stock price of 39.36 which reflects the closing price on January 4 2017 this represented a value of approximately 81 per St Jude Medical common share and total purchase consideration of 23.6 billion The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through a combination of medium and long-term debt issued in November 2016 and a 2.0 billion 120-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility which was subsequently repaid 25 Table of Contents In 2016 Abbott and St Jude Medical agreed to sell certain businesses to Terumo Corporation Terumo for approximately 1.12 billion The sale included the St Jude Medical Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure and Abbott s Vado Steerable Sheath businesses The sale closed on January 20 2017 and no gain or loss was recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings On October 3 2017 Abbott acquired Alere a diagnostic device and service provider for 51.00 per common share in cash which equated to a purchase price of approximately 4.5 billion As part of the acquisition Abbott tendered for Alere s preferred shares for a total value of approximately 0.7 billion In addition approximately 3.0 billion of Alere s debt was assumed and subsequently repaid The acquisition establishes Abbott as a leader in point of care testing expands Abbott s global diagnostics presence and provides access to new products channels and geographies Abbott utilized a combination of cash on hand and debt to fund the acquisition The preliminary allocation of the fair value of the Alere acquisition is shown in the table below The allocation of the fair value of the acquisition will be finalized when the valuation is completed and differences between the preliminary and final allocation could be material in billions Acquired intangible assets non-deductible 3.4 Goodwill non-deductible 4.2 Acquired net tangible assets 0.9 Deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition 0.7 Net debt 2.6 Preferred stock 0.7 Total preliminary allocation of fair value 4.5 The goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies from combining operations as well as intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition The goodwill is identifiable to the Diagnostic Products reportable segment The acquired tangible assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable of approximately 430 million inventory of approximately 425 million other current assets of 215 million property and equipment of approximately 540 million and other long-term assets of 112 million The acquired tangible liabilities consist of trade accounts payable and other current liabilities of approximately 625 million and other non-current liabilities of approximately 160 million In the third quarter of 2017 Alere entered into agreements to sell its Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel Corporation Quidel The transactions with Quidel reflect a total purchase price of 400 million payable at the close of the transaction 240 million payable in six annual installments beginning approximately six months after the close of the transaction and contingent consideration with a maximum value of 40 million In the third quarter of 2017 Alere entered into an agreement with Siemens Diagnostics Holding II B.V Siemens to sell its subsidiary Epocal Inc for approximately 200 million payable at the close of the transaction Alere agreed to divest these businesses in connection with the review by the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission of Abbott s agreement to acquire Alere The sale to Quidel closed on October 6 2017 and the sale to Siemens closed on October 31 2017 No gain or loss on these sales was recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings On July 17 2017 Abbott commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash the 1.77 million outstanding shares of Alere s Series B Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock at a price of 402 per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends to but not including the settlement date of the tender offer This tender offer was subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including Abbott s acquisition of Alere and upon there being validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at the expiration date of the tender offer that number of shares of Preferred Stock that equaled at least a majority of the Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the expiration of the tender offer The tender offer expired on October 3 2017 All conditions to the offer were satisfied and Abbott accepted for payment the 1.748 million shares of Preferred Stock that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn The remaining shares were cashed out for an amount equal to the 400.00 per share liquidation preference of such shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends without interest Payment for all of the shares of Preferred Stock was made in the fourth quarter of 2017 Restructuring Plans The results for the first six months of 2018 reflect charges under approved restructuring plans as part of the integration of the acquisition of St Jude Medical and Alere as well as costs related to other actions associated with the company s plans to streamline various operations Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of approximately 45 million in the first six months 26 Table of Contents of 2018 related to these initiatives Approximately 11 million is recognized in Cost of products sold 10 million is recognized in Research and development and approximately 24 million is recognized in Selling general and administrative expense See Note 10 to the financial statements Restructuring Plans for additional information regarding these charges Other Income Expense net Other income expense net decreased by 2 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 2017 and decreased by 1.1 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 The decrease in the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 was due to a pre-tax gain of 1.151 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2017 from Abbott s completion of the sale of AMO to Johnson  Johnson Interest Expense net Interest expense net increased 6 million in the second quarter of 2018 and 1 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to 2017 as lower interest income due to lower cash balances more than offset lower interest expense due to the repayment of debt Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations Taxes on earnings from continuing operations reflect the estimated annual effective rates and include charges for interest and penalties In the first six months of 2018 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include approximately 71 million in excess tax benefits associated with share-based compensation Earnings from discontinued operations net of tax in the first six months of 2018 reflect the recognition of 24 million of net tax benefits primarily as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years which decreased the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits by 31 million In the first six months of 2017 taxes on earnings from continuing operations include 430 million of tax expense related to the gain on the sale of the AMO business which is taxed at a discrete tax rate Earnings from discontinued operations net of tax of 46 million for the first six months of 2017 primarily reflects the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to prior years Tax authorities in various jurisdictions regularly review Abbott s income tax filings Abbott believes that it is reasonably possible that the recorded amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease between 500 million and 700 million including cash adjustments within the next twelve months as a result of concluding various domestic and international tax matters In the U.S Abbott s federal income tax returns through 2013 are settled except for the federal income tax returns of the former Alere consolidated group which are settled through 2012 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA  was enacted in the U.S on December 22 2017 The TCJA reduces the U.S federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings In the fourth quarter of 2017 Abbott recorded an estimate of net tax expense of 1.46 billion for the impact of the TCJA which was included in Taxes on Earnings from Continuing Operations in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings The estimate was provisional and included a charge of approximately 2.89 billion for the transition tax partially offset by a net benefit of approximately 1.42 billion for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and a net benefit of approximately 10 million related to certain other impacts of the TCJA In the first six months of 2018 Abbott recorded a 16 million adjustment to the provisional transition tax liability for associated effects related to state tax This adjustment increases the estimate of net tax expense for the impact of TCJA to 1.476 billion Given the significant complexity of the TCJA Abbott will continue to evaluate and analyze the impact of this legislation The 1.476 billion estimate is provisional and is based on Abbott s latest analysis of the TCJA and may be materially adjusted in future periods due to among other things additional analysis performed by Abbott and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S Department of Treasury the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Financial Accounting Standards Board Discontinued Operations On January 1 2013 Abbott completed the separation of AbbVie Inc AbbVie which was formed to hold Abbott s research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business Abbott has retained all liabilities for all U.S federal and foreign income taxes on income prior to the separation as well as certain non-income related taxes attributable to AbbVie s business prior to the separation AbbVie generally will be liable for all other taxes attributable to its business 27 Table of Contents Earnings from discontinued operations net of tax of 24 million and 46 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017 respectively were driven primarily by the recognition of net tax benefits as a result of the resolution of various tax positions related to AbbVie s operations for years prior to the separation Assets Held for Disposition As discussed in Note 8  Business Acquisitions in conjunction with the acquisition of Alere Abbott sold the Triage MeterPro cardiovascular and toxicology business and the assets and liabilities related to its B-type Natriuretic Peptide assay business run on Beckman Coulter analyzers to Quidel The legal transfer of certain assets and liabilities related to these businesses did not occur at the close of the sale to Quidel due to among other factors the time required to transfer marketing authorizations and other regulatory requirements in various countries Under the terms of the sale agreement with Abbott Quidel is subject to the risks and entitled to the benefits generated by these operations and assets The assets presented as held for disposition in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30 2018 and December 31 2017 primarily relate to the businesses sold to Quidel in millions June 30 2018 December 31 2017 Trade receivables net 13 12 Total inventories 4 8 Current assets held

196 Liquidity and Capital Resources June 30 2018 Compared with December 31 2017 The reduction of cash and cash equivalents from 9.4 billion at December 31 2017 to 3.1 billion at June 30 2018 primarily reflects repayment of debt and the payment of dividends partially offset by cash generated from operations in the first six months of 2018 Working capital was 5.2 billion at June 30 2018 and 11.2 billion at December 31 2017 The 6.0 billion decrease in working capital in 2018 is primarily due to the reduction in Cash and cash equivalents as discussed above Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2018 totaled 2.352 billion an increase of 427 million over the prior year due primarily to higher segment operating earnings continued improvements in working capital management timing of pension contributions and lower acquisition-related expenses Other net in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2018 was a use of 373 million and includes the impact of approximately 425 million of cash taxes paid The Other net line in Net cash from operating activities for the first six months of 2017 of 50 million includes the impact of approximately 430 million of tax expense associated with the disposition of businesses Other net in the first six months of 2017 also includes contributions to defined benefit pension plans of 321 million Abbott expects to fund cash dividends capital expenditures and its other investments in its businesses with cash flow from operating activities cash on hand short-term investments and borrowings In the first six months of 2017 Abbott sold 50 million of the Mylan N.V ordinary shares received upon the sale of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan Inc The sale of these shares generated cash proceeds of approximately 1.9 billion On January 5 2018 Abbott paid off its 2.8 billion 5-year term loan and the remaining 1.150 billion balance under its revolving credit agreement On February 16 2018 the board of directors authorized the redemption of up to 5 billion of currently outstanding long-term notes in addition to the 3.95 billion repaid in January 2018 On March 22 2018 Abbott redeemed all of the 947 million principal amount of its 5.125 Notes due 2019 as well as 1.055 billion of the 2.850 billion principal amount of its 2.35 Notes due 2019 Abbott incurred a net charge of 14 million related to the early repayment of this debt On June 22 2018 Abbott redeemed 1.3 billion of the 1.795 billion outstanding principal amount of its 2.35 Notes due 2019 At June 30 2018 Abbott s long-term debt rating was BBB by Standard  Poor s Corporation and Baa2 by Moody s Investors Service Abbott expects to maintain an investment grade rating Abbott has readily available financial resources including lines of credit of 5.0 billion which expire in 2019 28 Table of Contents In September 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 3.0 billion of Abbott s common shares from time to time The 2014 authorization was in addition to the 512 million unused portion of a previous program announced in June 2013 In the first six months of 2016 Abbott repurchased 10.4 million shares at a cost of 408 million under the program authorized in 2014 On April 27 2016 the board of directors authorized the issuance and sale for general corporate purposes of up to 75 million common shares that would result in proceeds of up to 3 billion No shares have been issued under this authorization In each of the first two quarters of 2018 Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of 0.28 per share on its common shares which represents an increase of approximately 6 over the 0.265 per share quarterly dividend declared in each of the first two quarters of 2017 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In February 2018 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU 2018-02 Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income which allows companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Abbott is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements In August 2017 the FASB issued ASU 2017-12 Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities which makes changes to the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Abbott is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements In February 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases on the balance sheet The standard becomes effective for Abbott beginning in the first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is permitted Adoption requires application of the new guidance for all periods presented Abbott is currently evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements Revenue Recognition Standard In May 2014 the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which provides a single comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers and supersedes nearly all previously existing revenue recognition guidance The core principle of the ASU is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services Abbott adopted the new standard as of January 1 2018 using the modified retrospective approach method Under this method entities recognize the cumulative effect of applying the new standard at the date of initial application with no restatement of comparative periods presented The cumulative effect of applying the new standard resulted in an increase to Earnings employed in the business in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet of 23 million which was recorded at January 1 2018 The impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 was not significant to individual financial statement line items on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings See Note 2 to the financial statements New Accounting Standards for additional information regarding recently issued accounting standards Legislative Issues Abbott s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulations throughout the world Abbott expects debate to continue over the availability method of delivery and payment for health care products and services It is not possible to predict the extent to which Abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future A more complete discussion of these factors is contained in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  A Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements Under the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Abbott cautions investors that any forward-looking statements or projections made by Abbott including those made in this document are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected Economic competitive governmental technological and other factors that may affect Abbott s operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K 29 Table of Contents PART I FINANCIAL INFORMATION Item 4 Controls and Procedures a Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures The Chief Executive Officer Miles D White and Chief Financial Officer Brian B Yoor evaluated the effectiveness of Abbott Laboratories  disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that Abbott Laboratories  disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information Abbott is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits with the Securities and Exchange Commission the Commission  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act  is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Abbott in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Abbott s management including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure b Changes in internal control over financial reporting During the quarter ended June 30 2018 there were no changes in Abbott s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f under the Exchange Act that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Abbott s internal control over financial reporting PART II OTHER INFORMATION Item 1 Legal Proceedings Abbott is involved in various claims legal proceedings and investigations including as of June 30 2018 except where noted below those described below While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such pending claims proceedings and investigations with certainty management is of the opinion that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on Abbott s financial position cash flows or results of operations In its 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K Abbott reported that Alere Toxicology Services Inc had reached an agreement with the U.S Environmental Protection Agency and agreed to pay a civil penalty of 186,225 with respect to potential violations of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act and associated regulations at its Austin Texas facility The civil penalty was paid in February 2018 and the matter was closed during the second quarter of 2018 in accordance with the agreement terms 30 Table of Contents Item 2
