reporting segments Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages Allstate Protection comprises three brands where we accept underwriting risk Allstate Esurance and Encompass Allstate

reinsurance coverage direct primary commercial insurance and other businesses in run-off These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources In fourth quarter 2017 we are changing our reportable segments See Note 15 Subsequent Events  of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further information.Underwriting income is calculated as premiums earned less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP  We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results Underwriting income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders below.The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Claims and claims expense loss  ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin.We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums

reestimates partially offset by higher catastrophe losses Frequency and severity statistics which are influenced by driving patterns inflation and other factors are provided to describe the trends in loss costs of the business Our reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns operational statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to determine our best estimate of recorded reserves.Paid claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed 68 www.allstate.com Allstate ProtectionAllstate brandEsurance brandEncompass brandSquareTradewith a payment or closed without payment Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events The percent change in paid or gross claim frequency is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency Paid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect little differences as timing between opening and settlement is minimal For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period The percent change in paid claim severity is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in paid claim severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid claims severity.Claims is operating in a continuous improvement environment actively focusing on effective loss cost management process efficiency and leveraging emerging

including capital gains and losses interest crediting rates to policyholders and the effect of any hedges In the third quarter of 2017 the review resulted in a deceleration of DAC amortization

returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-Based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-Based Core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-Based Active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-Based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk Returns are impacted by a variety of factors including general macroeconomic and public market conditions as public benchmarks are often used in the valuation of underlying investments Variability in earnings will also result from the performance of the underlying assets or business and the timing of sales of those investments Earnings from the sales of investments may be recorded as net investment income or realized capital gains and losses The portfolio which primarily includes private equity real estate infrastructure timber and

channel market interest rates equity market conditions and potential tax implications In addition the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance

review of the Secretary of the Treasury s report The Company has not been designated a SIFI under existing criteria nor does it anticipate a future SIFI designation if the activities and authorities of the FSOC are modified On September 29 2017 FSOC announced that in connection with its annual review of SIFI status required by Dodd-Frank it rescinded the SIFI designation of a large insurance
