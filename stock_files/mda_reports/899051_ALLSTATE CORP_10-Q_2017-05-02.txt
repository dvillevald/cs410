protection plans primarily covering consumer appliances and electronics such as TVs smartphones and computers This acquisition broadens Allstate s unique product offerings to better meet consumers  needs 45PROPERTY-LIABILITY OPERATIONSOverview Our Property-Liability operations consist of two reporting segments Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages Allstate Protection comprises three brands where we accept underwriting risk Allstate Esurance and Encompass Allstate Protection is principally engaged in the sale of personal property and casualty insurance primarily private passenger auto and homeowners insurance to individuals in the United States and Canada Allstate Protection also includes Allstate Roadside Services Allstate Dealer Services Arity and Ivantage which are included in Allstate brand and SquareTrade Discontinued Lines and Coverages includes results from property-liability insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources With the acquisition of SquareTrade and the strategic focus and expansion of Arity and other emerging businesses management is evaluating modifying the existing oversight structure and capital allocation processes.Underwriting income is calculated as premiums earned less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP  We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results Underwriting income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders below.The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Claims and claims expense loss  ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin.We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the percentage of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the percentage of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined ratio the percentage of amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned Amortization of purchased intangible assets is reported in operating costs and expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the percentage of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.46Summarized financial data a reconciliation of underwriting income to net income applicable to

reinsurance in excess of 1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event 50threshold of average claims in a specific area occurring within a certain amount of time following the event Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds winter storms and freezes tornadoes

average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by 2 billion net of reinsurance from hurricanes and earthquakes based on modeled assumptions and applications currently available Except for the Florida component of the program that is expected to be placed in the second quarter of 2017 we have substantially completed the placement of our 2017 catastrophe reinsurance program Similar to our 2016 program our 2017 program includes coverage for losses to personal lines property and automobile arising out of multiple perils in addition to hurricanes and earthquakes in all agreements except for two agreements placed in the insurance linked securities ILS  market forming part of our nationwide reinsurance program and the Kentucky agreement.The June 1 2017 nationwide reinsurance program excluding Florida and New Jersey where separate reinsurance agreements address the distinct needs of our separately capitalized legal entities in these states provides 4.4 billion of reinsurance limits less a 500 million retention subject to the percentage of reinsurance placed in each of its nine layers The nationwide reinsurance program includes reinsurance agreements with both the traditional and ILS markets as described below The traditional market placement provides limits totaling 2.5 billion comprised of 2.1 billion of limits for losses arising out of multiple perils with one annual reinstatement of limits and 439 million of limits for losses arising out of multiple perils with one reinstatement of limits over a seven year term The ILS placements provide 1.1 billion of limits with no reinstatement of the limits and are comprised of a 750 million placement reinsuring losses in certain states caused by hurricanes earthquakes and fire following earthquakes with amounts payable based on insured industry losses and further adjusted to account for our exposures in reinsured areas and a 375 million placement reinsuring losses in all states except Florida and New Jersey caused by named storms earthquakes and fire following earthquakes severe thunderstorms winter storms volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts Recoveries are limited to our ultimate net loss from the reinsured event and are subject to the placed limits The New Jersey agreement comprises three contracts that reinsure personal lines property and automobile catastrophe losses in New Jersey and provides 400 million of limits excess of provisional retentions of approximately 153 million Each contract includes one annual reinstatement of limits.The Pennsylvania agreement comprises a three-year term contract that reinsures personal lines property losses caused by multiple perils in Pennsylvania and provides 95 million of limits each year in excess of a 100 million retention The Kentucky Earthquake agreement comprises a three-year term contract that reinsures personal lines property losses caused by earthquakes and fires following earthquakes in Kentucky and provides 27 million of limits in excess of a 2 million retention.The total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs during the first quarter of 2017 was 93 million The total cost of our catastrophe reinsurance programs during 2016 was 393 million or an average quarterly cost of 98 million.52Reserve reestimates The tables below show reserves net of reinsurance representing the estimated cost of outstanding

frequency favorable prior year reserve reestimates and decreased catastrophe losses Frequency and severity statistics which are influenced by driving patterns inflation and other factors are provided to describe the trends in loss costs of the business Our reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns operational statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to determine our best estimate of recorded reserves.Paid claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed with a payment or closed without payment Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events The percent change in paid or gross claim frequency is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency Paid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect little differences as timing between opening and settlement is minimal For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity 58Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period The percent change in paid claim severity is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in paid claim severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid claims severity.Claims is undergoing continuous improvement focusing on effective loss cost management process efficiency and leveraging emerging technologies to enhance the customer experience to ensure our claim processes result in an easy settlement experience that is fast and fair We will simplify and streamline the claim handling process using automated loss notification real-time processing predicted damage assessments self-service capabilities and electronic payments.We have opened two Digital Operating Centers that are handling auto claims by estimating through photos including the use of QuickFoto Claim  We are assessing hail events utilizing drones piloted airplanes and satellite imagery and we launched Quick Card Pay in late 2016 an immediate payment method These advances will improve effectiveness and efficiency by providing greater consistency and accuracy quicker processing of claims and a better customer experience While these claims organizational and process changes are occurring frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as changes in claim opening and closing practices if any can impact comparisons to prior periods Property damage paid claim frequency decreased 3.2 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 Approximately 80 of individual states experienced a year over year decrease in property damage paid claim frequency in first quarter 2017 when compared to first quarter 2016 These declines were observed mainly in January and February as the country broadly experienced milder than normal winter weather Property damage paid claim severities increased 4.8 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to the impact of increased third party subrogation payments higher costs to repair more sophisticated newer model vehicles and increased volume of total losses.Bodily injury gross claim frequency decreased 6.0 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 Bodily injury paid claim frequency decreased 20.5 while bodily injury paid claim severity increased 25.1 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 These changes are related and reflect payment mix and claim closure patterns that were impacted by changes in bodily injury claim processes in the second half of 2016 related to enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments Paid claim severity was impacted by a reduced number of claims opened and a change in the mix of paid claims toward a higher proportion of larger severity payments and increases in medical inflationary trends that were offset by improvements in loss cost management Homeowners loss ratio decreased 0.1 points in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to increased premiums earned and higher favorable reserve reestimates partially offset by increased claim frequency Paid claim frequency excluding catastrophe losses increased 2.3 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 Paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 4.1 in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 Homeowner paid claim severity can be impacted by both the mix of perils and the magnitude of specific losses paid during the quarter.Commercial lines loss ratio decreased 15.4 points in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates compared to in the first quarter of 2016.Catastrophe losses were 706 million in the first

higher premiums and contract charges Life and annuity premiums and contract charges Premiums represent revenues generated from traditional life insurance accident and health insurance and immediate annuities with life contingencies that have significant mortality or morbidity risk Contract charges are revenues generated from interest-sensitive and variable life insurance and fixed annuities for which deposits 69are classified as contractholder funds or separate account liabilities Contract charges are assessed against the contractholder account values for maintenance administration cost of

benefits and operating costs and expenses partially offset by lower interest credited to contractholder funds Life and annuity contract benefits increased 4.2 or 19 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher life insurance mortality experience and growth at Allstate Benefits We analyze our mortality and morbidity results using the difference between premiums and contract charges earned for the cost of insurance and contract benefits excluding the portion related to the implied interest on immediate annuities with life

primarily due to increased employee-related costs and higher guaranty fund expenses In April 2016 the U.S Department of Labor DOL  issued a rule expanding the range of activities considered to be investment advice  and establishing a new framework for determining whether an entity or person is a fiduciary  when selling mutual funds variable and indexed annuities or variable life products in connection with an Individual Retirement Account IRA  or an employee benefit plan covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended ERISA  The rule in its current form would have an impact on the non-proprietary products provided by Allstate agencies and Allstate s broker-dealer Allstate Financial Services LLC their sales processes and volumes and producer compensation arrangements Allstate does not currently sell proprietary annuities or proprietary variable life products in connection with IRAs or employee benefit plans covered under ERISA Allstate Benefits offers universal life products which when sold in an employee welfare benefit plan may be considered subject to the fiduciary rule as an insurance product with an investment component Products that we previously offered and continue to have in force such as indexed annuities could also be impacted by the rule These requirements may increase regulatory costs and litigation exposure The financial impact to Allstate is expected to be immaterial The April 10 2017 applicability date of the rule was recently delayed Compliance of certain components of the rule is now required by June 9 2017 with full compliance still required by January 1 2018 The delay follows from the February 3 2017 memorandum from the President of the United States directing the DOL to examine the fiduciary duty rule to determine whether it may adversely affect investors or retirees and adversely affect the ability of Americans to gain access to retirement information and financial advice It is yet to be determined whether any other action including changes to the rule s requirements will result from the DOL s continued examination of the rule.74The following section provides more detail on the results for

income increased 2.8 or 8 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to higher yields on fixed income and equity securities partially offset by lower average investment balances The investment portfolio supporting our immediate annuities is managed to ensure the assets match the characteristics of the liabilities and provide the long-term returns needed to support this business To better match the long-term nature of our immediate annuities we continue to increase performance-based investments in which we have ownership interests and a greater proportion of return is derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance.Contract benefits decreased 2.7 or 4 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to favorable immediate annuity mortality experience.Interest credited to contractholder funds decreased 14.4 or 16 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of

advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-Based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-Based Core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-Based Active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-Based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and to replace market risk with idiosyncratic risk The return is a function of both general market conditions and the performance of the underlying assets or businesses The portfolio which primarily includes private equity real estate infrastructure timber and agriculture-related assets is diversified across a number of characteristics including managers or partners vintage years strategies geographies including international and industry sectors or property types These investments are generally illiquid in nature often require specialized expertise typically involve a third party manager and may offer the potential to add value through transformation at the company or property level A portion of these investments seek returns through asset dislocations or special situations primarily in private markets

for a period of time sufficient to recover unrealized losses given our preference to maintain flexibility to reposition the portfolio For certain equity securities managed by third parties we do not retain decision making authority as it pertains to selling securities that are in an unrealized loss position and therefore we recognize any unrealized loss at the end of the period through a charge

ratings and strength Our ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance asset quality liquidity asset/liability management overall portfolio mix financial leverage i.e debt exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage The preferred stock and subordinated debentures are viewed as having a common equity component by certain rating agencies and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined limit in our capital structure as determined by their respective methodologies These respective methodologies consider the existence of certain terms and features in the instruments such as the noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock There have been no changes to any of our ratings since December 31 2016.Liquidity sources and uses We actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market economic and business conditions Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the Company and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs Additionally we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility.Allstate Life Insurance Company ALIC  AIC Allstate Assurance Company AAC  and The Allstate Corporation are party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement Liquidity Agreement  which allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party ALIC and AIC each serve as a lender and borrower AAC serves only as a borrower and the Corporation serves only as a lender AIC also has a capital support agreement with ALIC Under the capital support agreement AIC is committed to provide capital to ALIC to maintain an adequate capital level The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is 1.00 billion.In addition to the Liquidity Agreement the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries which include but are not limited to AIC and ALIC The amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation s subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to 1.00 billion The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings.Parent company capital capacity At the parent holding company level we have deployable assets totaling 2.74 billion as of March 31 2017 comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter The substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation This provides funds for the parent company s fixed charges and other corporate purposes.86In the first three months of 2017 AIC paid dividends totaling 701 million to its parent Allstate Insurance Holdings LLC AIH  which then paid 701 million of dividends to the Corporation Dividends may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for We are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy net income or shareholders  equity levels except out of the net proceeds of common stock issued during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration As of March 31 2017 we satisfied all of the tests with no current restrictions on the payment of preferred stock dividends.The terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming purchasing acquiring or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures subject to certain limited exceptions In the first three months of 2017 we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.Additional borrowings to support liquidity are as follows The Corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing limit of 1.00 billion to cover short-term cash needs As of March 31 2017 there were no balances outstanding and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was 1.00 billion however the outstanding balance can fluctuate daily The Corporation AIC and ALIC have access to a 1.00 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements The maturity date of this facility is April 2021 The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being 115 million The commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional 500 million of borrowing This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5 debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement This ratio was 15.6 as of March 31 2017 Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured unguaranteed long-term debt There were no borrowings under the credit facility during the first quarter of 2017 The Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30 2015 We can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities common stock including 535 million shares of treasury stock as of March 31 2017 preferred stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.Liquidity exposure Contractholder funds were 20.05 billion as of March 31 2017 The following table summarizes contractholder funds by their contractual withdrawal provisions as of March 31 2017 in millions Percentto totalNot subject to discretionary withdrawal$3,090 15.4%Subject to discretionary withdrawal with adjustments Specified

Includes 1.22 billion of liabilities with a contractual surrender charge of less than 5 of the account balance 2 1.00 billion of the contracts with market value adjusted surrenders have a 30-45 day period at the end of their initial and subsequent interest rate guarantee periods which are typically 1 5 7 or 10 years during which there is no surrender charge or market value adjustment 3 89 of these contracts have a minimum interest crediting rate guarantee of 3 or higher 4 Includes 764 million of contractholder funds on variable annuities reinsured to The Prudential Insurance Company of America a subsidiary of Prudential Financial Inc in 2006.Retail life and annuity products may be surrendered by customers for a variety of reasons Reasons unique to individual customers include a current or unexpected need for cash or a change in life insurance coverage needs Other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge the length of time the contract has been in force distribution channel market interest rates equity market conditions and potential tax implications In addition the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products based on the beginning of year contractholder funds was 6.2 and 5.7 in the first 87three months of 2017 and 2016 respectively Allstate Financial strives to promptly pay customers who request cash surrenders however statutory regulations generally provide up to six months in most states to fulfill surrender requests.Our asset-liability management practices enable us to manage the differences between the cash flows generated by our investment portfolio and the expected cash flow requirements of our life insurance and annuity product obligations.The following table summarizes consolidated cash flow activities by segment for the three months ended March 31 in millions)Property-Liability (1 Allstate

dividends contributions and borrowings.Property-Liability Higher cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2017 compared to the first three months of 2016 was primarily due to lower claim and tax payments and increased premiums partially offset by higher operating expenses.Cash used in investing activities in the first three months of 2017 compared to cash provided in investing activities in the first three months of 2016 was primarily the result of increased purchases of fixed income securities and cash paid for the SquareTrade acquisition partially offset by a reduction in short-term investments and increased sales of equity securities Allstate Financial Lower cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2017 compared to the first three months of 2016 was primarily due to a decrease in payables and higher payments for operating expenses partially offset by higher premiums on accident and health and traditional life insurance products.Higher cash provided by investing activities in the first three months of 2017 compared to the first three months of 2016 was the result of a reduction in short-term investments to fund the dividends paid by ALIC to AIC Cash used in financing activities in the first three months of 2017 was comparable to the first three months of 2016.Corporate and Other Fluctuations in the Corporate and Other operating cash flows were primarily due to the timing of intercompany settlements Investing activities primarily relate to investments in the parent company portfolio Financing cash flows of the Corporate and Other segment reflect actions such as fluctuations in dividends to shareholders of The Allstate Corporation common share repurchases short-term debt repayment of debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt and preferred stock therefore financing cash flows are affected when we increase or decrease the level of these activities.RECENT DEVELOPMENTSDodd-Frank The Secretary of the Treasury operating through Federal Insurance Office FIO  and the Office of the U.S Trade Representative USTR  are jointly authorized pursuant to Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd-Frank  to negotiate a Covered Agreement with one or more foreign governments authorities or regulatory entities A Covered Agreement is a written bilateral or multilateral agreement that relates to the recognition of prudential measures with respect to the business of insurance or reinsurance that achieves a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation A Covered Agreement may become effective 90 days after the Secretary of the Treasury and USTR jointly submit a final agreement to the House Financial Services House Ways and Means Senate Banking and Senate Finance committees The House and Senate committees are not required to vote on the Covered Agreement for it to become effective Following expiration of the 90 day holdover period which occurred on April 13 2017 the U.S Treasury Secretary and USTR must sign the agreement and provide the final written notification to the European Union EU  for the Covered Agreement to become effective As provided in Dodd-Frank a Covered Agreement cannot preempt i.e displace state insurance measures that govern an insurer s rates premiums underwriting or sales practices any state insurance coverage requirements the application of antitrust laws of any state to the business of insurance or any state insurance measure governing insurer capital or solvency except where a state insurance measure results in less favorable treatment of a non-U.S insurer than a U.S insurer In November 2015 pursuant to Dodd-Frank Treasury and USTR notified Congress that they were formally initiating negotiations on a Covered Agreement with the EU the Covered Agreement  addressing permanent equivalence treatment of the U.S regulatory system by the EU confidential sharing of information across jurisdictions and uniform treatment of EU-based reinsurers operating in the U.S including with respect to reinsurance collateral On January 13 2017 the Secretary of the Treasury 88and USTR jointly submitted a Covered Agreement consistent with their November 2015 notification to Congress Once effective the Covered Agreement is designed to secure equivalence treatment of the U.S regulatory system by the EU addresses the confidential sharing of information by regulators across jurisdictions and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for EU-based foreign reinsurers in all States that meet certain conditions In accordance with authorities provided in Dodd-Frank the Covered Agreement may preempt i.e displace state laws after 60 months from its effective date if then existing State insurance measures affected by the Covered Agreement result in less favorable treatment of an EU insurer or reinsurer subject to the Covered Agreement than a U.S insurer domiciled licensed or otherwise admitted in a U.S State.Prior to the Secretary of the Treasury and the USTR submitting the Covered Agreement to Congress the NAIC had amended its Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation in 2011 Revised Reinsurance Model Law  and statutory enactments implementing the amendments have been passed in 35 states The amendments establish a new category of certified reinsurers allowing domestic insurers to receive statutory capital credit for reinsurance ceded to certified reinsurers absent the reinsurers fully collateralizing their assumed reinsurance obligations Under the NAIC s regulatory scheme preceding the Revised Reinsurance Model Law which remains in effect in Illinois domestic ceding companies are not allowed to take statutory capital credit for reserves ceded to unauthorized reinsurers unless the insurer withholds funds due to the reinsurer in an amount equal to the reserves obtains a letter of credit on behalf of the unauthorized reinsurer equal to the amount of the reserves or is the beneficiary of a credit for reinsurance trust with assets equal to the amount of the reserves.The terms of the Covered Agreement provide states with 60 months from the effective date of the Covered Agreement to modify their state-based regulatory requirements to comply with the terms of the Covered Agreement In accordance with the terms of the Covered Agreement and consistent with the authorities set forth in Dodd-Frank after 42 months from the effective date of the Covered Agreement the U.S is to begin a process of notifying states of potential preemption for any state insurance measure that is inconsistent with the terms of the Covered Agreement After 60 months from the effective date of the Covered Agreement the U.S is to complete any preemption determinations with respect to any U.S State insurance measures subject to evaluation On June 23 2016 the U.K held a referendum in which they voted to leave the EU The U.K Prime Minister notified the European Council on March 29 2017 of its intention to withdraw from the EU under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty Once notification is given Article 50 provides two years unless the parties agree to extend the withdrawal period to reach an agreement on the terms of the withdrawal If no extensions are agreed to the withdrawal would be expected to be completed in March 2019 Article 50 provides only for the negotiation of a withdrawal arrangement but does not address future relationships between the U.K and EU Upon exiting the EU the U.K insurance market will no longer be in the scope of the Covered Agreement.Federal Reserve Board In June 2016 the Federal Reserve Board FRB  issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting comments on two separate capital framework proposals developed for insurance groups designated as systemically important financial institutions SIFI  and insurance companies that own insured depository institutions IDIs  As of December 31 2016 we are not designated as a SIFI and do not own an IDI The proposals at a very high level describe how capital and financial risk could be measured The capital proposal applicable to insurance IDIs uses a Building Block Approach BBA  The BBA uses as a starting point available and required capital obtained from existing regulatory frameworks such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk-Based Capital developed from financial statements constructed using Statutory Accounting Principles SAP  and applies a Basel-like approach to remaining assets not covered by a specific regulatory framework The proposed capital framework applicable to SIFI s would be a Consolidated Approach which would rely on a new risk-based framework to be applied to consolidated U.S GAAP based financial measures While the proposed application of the SIFI proposal is limited the potential implication of its wider application could be significant Most insurance groups including those that currently prepare financial statements in accordance with U.S GAAP typically do not develop audited U.S GAAP financial statements for all domestic and international insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries The current Consolidated Approach proposal as communicated does not require insurance companies subject to the framework to prepare U.S GAAP financial statements for their underlying subsidiaries However any change to the final rule which requires application of risk-based capital requirements to audited U.S GAAP financial statements at the subsidiary level would require the preparation of U.S GAAP financial statements This could create significant incremental costs to maintain audited financial statements and maintenance of regulatory capital computations for subsidiaries on both a U.S GAAP and SAP basis The FRB proposals remain in the development stage and their final form content and applicability of the framework(s may be significantly different from the current proposals.On April 21 2017 the President signed an Executive Order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a review of the SIFI designation process and provide a written report within 180 days of the date of the Executive Order The Executive Order directs the Secretary of the Treasury to consider among other attributes whether the designation process is sufficiently transparent provides entities with adequate due process is supported by quantified risk assessments and whether the designated entity is provided an opportunity to reduce identified risks to avoid SIFI designation The Executive Order also directs the Secretary of the Treasury to evaluate the activities of the Financial Stability Oversight Council related to its authority to make SIFI designations and determine whether that authority is consistent with the Presidential Executive Order on Core Principles for Regulating the 89U.S Financial System Lastly the Executive Order temporarily suspends SIFI determinations and designations pending submission and review of the Secretary of the Treasury s report Forward-Looking
