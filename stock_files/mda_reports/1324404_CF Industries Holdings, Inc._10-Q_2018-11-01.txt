temperatures throughout much Midwestern United States United Kingdom delayed spring application season impacted sales volume This delay spring application season resulted high inventory levels entering much second quarter volume typically shipped first quarter instead shipped second quarter 2018 Through first half 2018 sales volume products approximately 1 compared first half 2017.For three months ended September 30 2018 sales volume products 4.8 million product tons decrease 2 compared sales volume 4.9 million product tons three months ended September 30 2017 resulting decrease net sales approximately 25 million Our total sales volume decreased due primarily lower ammonia supply availability driven lower level beginning inventory lower AN production result plant turnaround maintenance activity These decreases partially offset higher granular urea sales supported increased production For nine months ended September 30 2018 sales volume products essentially unchanged compared nine months ended September 30 2017 Selling Prices The U.S Gulf major global fertilizer pricing point due volume nitrogen fertilizer trades Through 2016 nitrogen pricing U.S Gulf declined often trading parity international pricing points due combination new global nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 continued imports various exporting regions decreased North American buyer interest result greater global nitrogen supply availability Seasonal decreases agricultural demand combined delayed customer purchasing activity resulted multi-year lows nitrogen fertilizer selling prices second half 2016 In 2017 significant price fluctuations experienced continued symptoms market transition new production capacity came line global trade flows began adjust In 2018 higher energy
