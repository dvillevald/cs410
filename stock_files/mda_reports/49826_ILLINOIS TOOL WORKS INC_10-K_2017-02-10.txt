reserve recorded adjust inventory cost net realizable value based following usage criteria:Usage Classification Criteria Reserve %Active Quantity hand less prior 6 months usage 0%Slow-moving Some usage last 12 months quantity hand exceeds prior 6 months usage 50%Obsolete No usage last 12 months 90%In addition approximately 22 total inventories Company elected use last-in first-out LIFO method inventory costing Generally method results lower inventory value first-in first-out FIFO method due effects inflation.Collectibility Accounts Receivable The Company estimates allowance uncollectible accounts based greater specific reserve reserve calculated based historical write-off percentage last two years In addition reserves customer credits cash discounts estimated based past

number factors including business plans economic projections anticipated future cash flows comparable transactions market data There inherent uncertainties related factors management judgment applying

million The expected long-term return plan assets based historical expected long-term returns similar investment allocations among asset classes For U.S primary pension plan 25 basis point decrease expected return plan assets would increase annual pension expense approximately 4 million.Beginning 2017 Company changed method used estimate service interest cost components net periodic pension postretirement benefit costs The new method provide precise measure service interest cost components net periodic benefit cost applying specific spot rates along yield curve projected cash flows rather single weighted-average rate The change expected material impact 2017 net periodic pension postretirement benefit costs decrease service interest costs largely offset impact lower discount
