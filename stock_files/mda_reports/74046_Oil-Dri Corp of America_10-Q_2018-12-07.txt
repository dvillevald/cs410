Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S GAAP  for interim financial information and in compliance with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X Accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S GAAP for complete financial statements The financial statements and the related notes are condensed and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes for the fiscal year ended July 31 2018 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Oil-Dri Corporation of America and its subsidiaries All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated Except as otherwise indicated herein or as the context otherwise requires references to Oil-Dri the Company we us  or our  refer to Oil-Dri Corporation of America and its subsidiaries.The unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals and reclassifications which are in the opinion of management necessary for a fair presentation of the statements contained herein In addition certain prior year reclassifications were made to conform to the current year presentation Operating results for the three months ended October 31 2018 are not necessarily an indication of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending July 31 2019.Management Use of EstimatesThe preparation of the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosures All of our estimates and assumptions are revised periodically Actual results could differ from these estimates.Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesExcept as described herein our significant accounting policies which are detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31 2018 have not materially changed However the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect changes required upon adoption of new accounting guidance as described in Note 2 The following is a description of certain of our significant accounting policies.Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with customers are satisfied Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell finished products to wholesalers distributors and retailers or consumers and our obligations have an original duration of one year or less Control of the finished products are transferred upon shipment to or receipt at customers locations as determined by the specific terms of the contract We have completed our performance obligation when control is transferred and we recognize revenue accordingly We have an unconditional right to consideration under the payment terms specified in the contract upon completion of the performance obligation We may require certain customers to provide payment in advance of product shipment We recorded a liability for these advance payments of 96,000 and 242,000 as of October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 respectively This liability is reported in Other Accrued Expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Revenue recognized during the first quarter ended October 31 2018 that was included in the liability for advance payments at the beginning of the period was 84,000 We routinely commit to one-time or ongoing trade promotion programs directly with consumers such as coupon programs and with customers such as volume discounts cooperative marketing and other arrangements We estimate and accrue the expected costs of these programs These costs are considered variable consideration under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and are netted against sales when revenue is recorded The accruals are based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing obligations on products sold as of the balance sheet date To estimate these accruals we rely on our historical experience of trade spending patterns and that of the industry current trends and forecasted data 9Selling General and Administrative Expenses Selling general and administrative expenses SG&A  include salaries wages and benefits associated with staff outside the manufacturing and distribution functions all marketing related costs any miscellaneous trade spending expenses not required to be included in net sales research and development costs depreciation and amortization related to assets outside the manufacturing and distribution process and all other non-manufacturing and non-distribution expenses.Trade Receivables We record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and a periodic review of our accounts receivable including a review of the overall aging of accounts consideration of customer credit risk and analysis of facts and circumstances about specific customer accounts A customer account is determined to be uncollectible when it is probable that a loss will be incurred after we have completed our internal collection procedures including termination of shipments direct customer contact and formal demand of payment.Overburden Removal and Mining Costs We mine sorbent materials on property that we either own or lease as part of our overall operations A significant part of our overall mining cost is incurred during the process of removing the overburden non-usable material from the mine site thus exposing the sorbent material used in a majority of our production processes These stripping costs are treated as a variable inventory production cost and are included in cost of sales in the period they are incurred We defer and amortize the pre-production overburden removal costs associated with opening a new mine.Additionally it is our policy to capitalize the purchase cost of land and mineral rights including associated legal fees survey fees and real estate fees The costs of obtaining mineral patents including legal fees and drilling expenses are also capitalized Pre-production development costs on new mines and any prepaid royalties that may be offset against future royalties due upon extraction of the minerals are also capitalized All exploration related costs are expensed as incurred.We perform ongoing reclamation activities during the normal course of our overburden removal As overburden is removed from a mine site it is hauled to previously mined sites and is used to refill older sites This process allows us to continuously reclaim older mine sites and dispose of overburden simultaneously therefore minimizing the costs associated with the reclamation process.2 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND REGULATIONSRecently Issued PronouncementsIn February 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB  issued guidance under ASC 842 Leases which provides that for leases with a term greater than 12 months a lessee must recognize in the statement of financial position both a liability to make lease payments and an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset Other requirements describe expense recognition as well as financial statement presentation and disclosure This guidance is effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients Early adoption is permitted We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this requirement on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In June 2016 the FASB issued guidance under ASC 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses which requires companies to utilize an impairment model for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments which include trade and other receivables loans and held-to-maturity debt securities to record an allowance for credit risk based on expected losses rather than incurred losses In addition this new guidance changes the recognition method for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities which can occur as a result of market and credit risk as well as additional disclosures In general this guidance will require modified retrospective adoption for all outstanding instruments that fall under this guidance This guidance is effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2021 We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this requirement on our Consolidated Financial Statements.There have been no other accounting pronouncements issued but not yet adopted by us which are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.Recently Adopted PronouncementsIn May 2014 the FASB issued guidance under ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and subsequently issued several amendments to further clarify the principles for recognizing revenue This guidance establishes a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and will supersede most existing revenue guidance The core principle of ASC 606 is that entities should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange 10Oil-Dri adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis effective August 1 2018 We applied the practical expedient available under ASC 606 to disregard determining significant financing components if the good is transferred and payment is received within one year We also adopted the policy election to exclude from the transaction price all amounts collected from customers for sales and other taxes We do not expect a material impact on our annual Consolidated Financial Statements from the adoption of this guidance Results for periods beginning on or after August 1 2018 are recognized and presented in accordance with ASC 606 while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the prior account guidance under ASC 605 Revenue Recognition.In January 2016 the FASB issued guidance under ASC 825 Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities This guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments This guidance was effective for our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 The provisions relevant to us relate to fair value disclosures for our notes payable which are measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet These provisions require the use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes as well as eliminate the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value in such disclosure This guidance impacted our disclosures only on a prospective basis and did not have a material impact on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements See Note 4 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about Fair Value Measurements.In March 2017 the FASB issued guidance under ASC 715 Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost which requires presenting the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in the same income statement line item(s as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period This standard also requires that other components of the net periodic benefit cost be presented separately from the line items that includes service costs and outside of any subtotal of operating income if one is presented on a retrospective basis We adopted this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and accordingly recorded the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost in Other Income Expense in the line item Other net on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained Earnings As such the adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements See Note 8 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about our pension and postretirement health plans.3 INVENTORIESThe composition of inventories is as follows in thousands October 31 2018 July 31 2018Finished goods$15,557 $14,223Packaging5,908 5,349Other3,948 2,949Total Inventories$25,413 $22,521Inventories are valued at the lower of cost first-in first-out or net realizable value Inventory costs include the cost of raw materials packaging supplies labor and other overhead costs We performed a detailed review of our inventory items to determine if an obsolescence reserve adjustment was necessary The review surveyed all of our operating facilities and sales groups to ensure that both historical issues and new market trends were considered The obsolescence reserve not only considered specific items but also took into consideration the overall value of the inventory as of the balance sheet date The inventory obsolescence reserve values at October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 were 1,140,000 and 1,136,000 respectively The reserve increased due to higher levels of discontinued slow moving and unsaleable inventory 114 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date The inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized into categories based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement The categories in the fair value hierarchy are as follows:Level 1 Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2 Observable market-based inputs for similar assets or liabilities or valuation models whose inputs are observable directly or indirectly.Level 3 Unobservable inputs.Cash equivalents of 6,503,000 and 9,920,000 as of October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 respectively were classified as Level 1 These cash instruments are primarily money market mutual funds and are included in cash and cash equivalents on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.Short-term investments included U.S Treasury securities and certificates of deposit We intend and have the ability to hold our short-term investments to maturity therefore these investments were reported at amortized cost which approximated fair value as of October 31 2018 and July 31 2018.Balances of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated their fair values at October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 due to the short maturity and nature of those balances.Notes payable are reported at the face amount of future maturities The estimated fair value of notes payable including current maturities was 6,533,000 and 9,553,000 as of October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 respectively and are classified as Level 2 The fair value as of October 31 2018 was determined using the exit price notion of fair value required by the adoption of new accounting guidance for fiscal year 2019 as discussed in Note 2 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.We apply fair value techniques on at least an annual basis associated with 1 valuing potential impairment loss related to goodwill trademarks and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and 2 valuing potential impairment loss related to long-lived assets See Note 5 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about goodwill and other intangible assets.5 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETSIntangible amortization expense was 210,000 and 254,000 in the first quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively Estimated intangible amortization for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 is 627,000 Estimated intangible amortization for the next five fiscal years is as follows in thousands 2020$6672021$4842022$3342023$2022024$68We have one acquired trademark recorded at a cost of 376,000 that was determined to have an indefinite life and is not amortized.We performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and no impairment was identified There have been no triggering events that would indicate a new impairment analysis is needed 126 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITSThe components of net periodic pension and postretirement health benefit costs were as follows Pension Benefits (in thousands For the Three Months Ended October 31 2018 2017Service cost$422 $424Interest

components of net periodic benefit cost are included in Other Income Expense in the line item Other net on the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Retained Earnings.The pension plan is funded based upon actuarially determined contributions that take into account the amount deductible for income tax purposes the normal cost and the minimum contribution required and the maximum contribution allowed under applicable regulations We were not required to make and did not make a contribution to the pension plan during the first three months of fiscal year 2019 We have no minimum funding requirements for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 We contributed 335,000 to our pension plan during the first three months of fiscal year 2018 We made a significant voluntary contribution to the pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 This voluntary contribution improved the plan's funded status and contributed to a lower net periodic benefit expense for the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.The postretirement health plan is an unfunded plan We pay insurance premiums and claims from our assets 13Assumptions used in the previous calculations were as follows Pension Benefits Postretirement Health Benefits For the Three Months Ended October 31 2018 2017 2018

1 Retail and Wholesale Products Group and 2 Business to Business Products Group These operating segments are managed separately and each segment's major customers have different characteristics The Retail and Wholesale Products Group customers include mass merchandisers wholesale clubs drugstore chains pet specialty retail outlets dollar stores retail grocery stores distributors of industrial cleanup and automotive products environmental service companies and sports field product users The Business to Business Products Group customers include processors and refiners of edible oils petroleum-based oils and biodiesel fuel manufacturers of animal feed and agricultural chemicals distributors of animal health and nutrition products and marketers of consumer products Our operating segments are also our reportable segments The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual

cost for the pension and postretirement health plans See Note 6 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information 1610 INCOME TAXESWe used an estimated annual effective tax rate in determining our quarterly provision for income taxes which is based on expected annual taxable income and the assessment of various tax deductions including depletion Certain significant or unusual items areseparately recognized in the quarter in which they occur and can be a source of variability in the effective tax rates from quarter to quarter Tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 was reduced by 175,000 based on initial findings during an ongoing federal income tax return examination Excluding this tax adjustment the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 would have been 14 compared to 21 for the same period of the prior year The decrease in the effective tax rate for the current period was primarily due to the corporate income tax rate reduction resulting from enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act the 2017 Tax Act  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 The 2017 Tax Act included a number of changes to existing U.S tax laws that impact us most notably a reduction of the U.S corporate statutory income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective January 1 2018 and acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27 2017 as well as prospective changes including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction and capitalization of research and development expenditures We continued to obtain prepare and analyze information necessary to finalize the accounting for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Act As such our financial results reflect provisional estimates of items for which the income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Act have not been completed as of October 31 2018 Adjustments to the provisional charges will be recorded as discrete items in the provision for income taxes in the period in when those adjustments become reasonably estimable and/or the accounting is complete We will complete our analysis no later than December 22 2018.11 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSOne member of our Board of Directors is the President and Chief Executive Officer of a customer of ours That customer was a customer of ours before the board member joined that customer and before he became a member of our Board of Directors Total net sales to that customer including sales to subsidiaries of that customer were 97,000 and 86,000 for the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively Outstanding accounts receivable from that customer and its subsidiaries were 60,000 and 14,000 as of October 31 2018 and July 31 2018 respectively.One member of our Board of Directors and of the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors is the President and Chief Executive Officer as well as a director and shareholder of a law firm that regularly provides services to us Total payments to that vendor for fees and cost reimbursements were 46,000 and 63,000 for the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively Outstanding accounts payable to that vendor were 9,000 as of October 31 2018 There were no outstanding accounts payable to that vendor as of July 31 2018 17ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included herein and our Consolidated Financial Statements accompanying notes and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31 2018 This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements Factors that might cause a difference include but are not limited to those discussed under Forward-Looking Statements  and Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31 2018 which contained among other risk factors a description of the issues that may arise with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system which became operational on August 1 2018.OVERVIEWWe develop mine manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and to a lesser extent other clay-like sorbent materials Our principal products include agricultural and horticultural chemical carriers animal health and nutrition products bleaching clay and fluid purification aids cat litter industrial and automotive floor absorbents and sports field products Our products are sold to two primary customer groups including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end consumer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product We have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups Retail and Wholesale Products Group and Business to Business Products Group as described in Note 7 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.RESULTS OF OPERATIONSTHREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31 2018 COMPARED TOTHREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31 2017CONSOLIDATED RESULTSConsolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31 2018 were 66,143,000 compared to 66,646,000 for the three months ended October 31 2017 Net sales were up for the Retail and Wholesale Products Group but were down for the Business to Business Products Group.Consolidated gross profit for the three months ended October 31 2018 was 16,010,000 which was 24.2 of net sales compared to 18,975,000 which was 28.5 of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Gross profit was negatively impacted by higher freight packaging and non-fuel manufacturing costs which were partially offset by lower natural gas costs Freight costs per ton increased more than 20 over the same quarter of the prior fiscal year A shortage of drivers and new regulations in the trucking industry resulted in less truck availability and higher freight rates The truck shortage has shifted transportation demand to railroads which are also facing capacity constraints Furthermore we incurred additional freight costs for an increased number of product transfers between our plants and warehouses to support customer service during the start up of our new enterprise resource planning ERP  system on August 1 2018 and during disruptions due to Hurricane Michael Packaging costs per ton were approximately 13 higher compared to the first quarter of the prior fiscal year Significant amounts of our packaging purchases are subject to contractual price adjustments throughout the year based on underlying commodity prices including both resin and paper-based packaging Non-fuel manufacturing costs per ton produced were up approximately 5 including higher labor costs In addition our plants incurred some processing interruptions during the ERP system startup and one plant lost electricity for three days after Hurricane Michael Conversely the cost per manufactured ton for natural gas used to operate kilns that dry our clay was approximately 6 lower in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.Total SG&A expenses were approximately 2 higher for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 The discussion below describes the SG&A expenses allocated to the operating segments The remaining unallocated corporate expenses in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were approximately 10 lower compared to the first quarter of the prior year This decrease was due primarily to a lower estimated annual incentive bonus accrual which was partially offset by higher costs related to the implementation of our new ERP system The bonus accruals were based on performance targets established for each fiscal year 18A tax benefit of 50,000 was recorded for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to tax expense of 789,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 See Note 10 of the Notes to unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about income taxes.Consolidated net income of 906,000 was reported for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 a 70 decrease compared to net income of 3,050,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 The increased costs for freight packaging manufacturing and SG&A described above drove the decline in net income Diluted net earnings per share of 0.12 was reported for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to diluted net income per share of 0.41 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.BUSINESS TO BUSINESS PRODUCTS GROUPNet sales of the Business to Business Products Group for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were 25,326,000 a decrease of 1,761,000 or 7 from net sales of 27,087,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Net sales of fluids purification products were down approximately 6 Price competition due to the strength of the U.S Dollar in Brazil resulted in loss of sales to local suppliers This decline was partially offset by higher domestic sales of fluids purification products due to the characteristics of recent crops that are processed to create edible oils Net sales of our co-packaged coarse cat litter for the first quarter were down approximately 15 compared to the first quarter of the prior year Net sales of our animal health and nutrition products were approximately 10 lower than the first quarter of the prior year Sales of these products to Asia weakened due to a swine virus outbreak and sales to a distributor in Africa were down due to timing of orders Net sales of agricultural and horticultural products were essentially flat.SG&A expenses for the Business to Business Products Group were approximately 5 higher compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 due primarily to increased costs to promote our animal health and nutrition products The Business to Business Products Group s operating income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 7,032,000 a decrease of 1,844,000 or 21 from operating income of 8,876,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Operating income declined as the result of lower sales and higher SG&A expenses as discussed above along with increased freight packaging and manufacturing costs See Consolidated Results  above for further discussion of freight packaging and manufacturing costs.RETAIL AND WHOLESALE PRODUCTS GROUPNet sales of the Retail and Wholesale Products Group for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were 40,817,000 an increase of 1,258,000 or 3 from net sales of 39,559,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Total cat litter net sales were 5 higher compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 driven by sales of private label lightweight and traditional scoopable litters Sales of private label scoopable litters increased to existing customers and a new customer provided incremental sales In addition sales of private label coarse litter to our largest customer were up compared to the first quarter of the prior year Both our branded scoopable and coarse litter sales also contributed to the overall sales increase including more e-commerce sales of our lightweight litter Net sales of industrial and automotive absorbent products were down slightly compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.SG&A expenses for the Retail and Wholesale Products Group were approximately 22 higher compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 The increase was driven by about 416,000 higher advertising expense including spending for television and social media promotional integrations with a national talk show We expect advertising expense for the full year of fiscal year 2019 to be similar to fiscal year 2018 SG&A expense also included customer compliance fees for shipping and data communication problems during the start up of the ERP system.For the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 the Retail and Wholesale Products Group reported operating income of 9,000 a decrease of 2,356,000 compared to operating income of 2,365,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 The decrease in operating income was driven by increased freight packaging and manufacturing costs along with higher SG&A expenses as discussed above These cost increases were partially offset by higher sales See Consolidated Results  above for further discussion of freight packaging and manufacturing costs 19FOREIGN OPERATIONSForeign operations included our subsidiaries in Canada and the United Kingdom which are reported in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group and our subsidiaries in China and Mexico which are reported in the Business to Business Products Group Net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 were 3,443,000 a 17 increase compared to net sales of 2,937,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 Our subsidiary in Mexico was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and provided small amount of incremental sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 Net sales were up slightly for fluids purification products sold by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom due primarily to higher sales to a major customer Net sales were also up for cat litter sold by our subsidiary in Canada due primarily to increased distribution and promotion Partially offsetting these increases were lower sales of animal health and nutrition products by our subsidiary in China Our foreign subsidiaries net sales represented approximately 5 and 4 of consolidated net sales during the first quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively.Our foreign subsidiaries reported net income attributable to Oil-Dri of 236,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to net income of 199,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 The improved profitability was driven by the increased sales discussed above which was partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESOur principal capital requirements include funding working capital needs purchasing and upgrading equipment facilities information systems and real estate supporting new product development investing in infrastructure repurchasing stock paying dividends making pension contributions and business acquisitions During the first three months of fiscal year 2019 we principally used cash generated from operations to fund these requirements.The following table sets forth certain elements of our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in thousands For the Three Months Ended October 31 2018 2017Net cash provided by operating activities$684 $2,568Net cash provided by investing activities424 1,431Net cash used in financing activities(4,845 4,663)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(1 30)Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents 3,738 694)Net cash provided by operating activitiesIn addition to net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and other non-cash operating activities the primary sources and uses of operating cash flows for the first three months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were as follows:Accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts increased 6,410,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease of 696,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 The implementation of the new ERP system on August 1 2018 resulted in delays in sending invoices to some customers which had an adverse impact on our cash flow The variation in accounts receivable balances also reflected differences in the level and timing of sales and collections as well as the payment terms provided to various customers.Inventory increased 2,933,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to an increase of 154,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 Finished goods packaging and other raw materials inventories increased due to anticipated sales requirements and processing interruptions during the new ERP system implementation.Prepaid expenses increased 1,196,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to an increase of 1,361,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 Prepayments of annual insurance premiums contributed to the increase in both fiscal years In addition prepaid income taxes increased in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 and prepaid advertising expenses increased the first three months of fiscal year 2018.Accounts payable increased 7,290,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease of 825,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 Higher costs for packaging and other operating expenses contributed to the increase in accounts payable at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 In addition we carefully managed our cash flow during the 20first quarter due to transitional issues related to the new ERP system Trade and freight payables varied in both periods due to the timing of payments fluctuations in the cost of goods and services we purchased production volume levels and vendor payment terms.Accrued expenses decreased 1,780,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to a decrease of 3,275,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 The payout of the prior fiscal year's discretionary incentive bonus drove lower accrued salaries in the first three months of both fiscal years Furthermore the accrual at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was significantly lower than as of the same period in the prior fiscal year Accrued plant expenses also fluctuated due to timing of payments changes in the cost of goods and services we purchased production volume levels and vendor payment terms.Net cash provided by investing activitiesCash provided by investing activities was 424,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 compared to cash provided by investing activities of 1,431,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018 Purchases and dispositions of investment securities in both periods were impacted by variations in the timing of investment maturities the operating cash needs of the Company and the availability of investment options Cash used for capital expenditures was 4,058,000 and 4,045,000 in the first three months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 respectively.Net cash used in financing activitiesCash used in financing activities of 4,845,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2019 was comparable to cash used in financing activities of 4,663,000 in the first three months of fiscal year 2018.OtherTotal cash and investment balances held by our foreign subsidiaries of 1,984,000 as of October 31 2018 were slightly lower than the October 31 2017 balances of 2,051,000 See further discussion in Foreign Operations  above.We have a 25,000,000 unsecured revolving credit agreement with BMO Harris which expires on December 4 2019 The agreement also provides for a maximum of 5,000,000 for foreign letters of credit Under the agreement we may select a variable interest rate based on either the BMO Harris prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate plus a margin that varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio or a fixed rate as agreed between us and BMO Harris As of October 31 2018 the variable rates would have been 5.25 for the BMO Harris prime-based rate or 3.46 for the LIBOR-based rate The credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that among other things and under various conditions limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets The agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth As of October 31 2018 and 2017 we were in compliance with the covenants There were no borrowings during the first three months of either fiscal years 2019 or 2018.As of October 31 2018 we had remaining authority to repurchase 296,277 shares of Common Stock under a repurchase plan approved by our Board of Directors the Board  In addition on March 21 2018 the Board authorized the repurchase of 300,000 shares of Class B Stock however there have been no repurchases of Class B Stock Repurchases may be made on the open market pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans or otherwise or in negotiated transactions The timing and number of shares repurchased will be determined by our management.We believe that cash flow from operations availability under our revolving credit facility current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing if necessary will provide adequate cash funds for foreseeable working capital needs capital expenditures at existing facilities deferred compensation payouts dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months We plan to continue promoting our lightweight cat litter products and we expect advertising expense in fiscal year 2019 to similar to fiscal year 2018 We also anticipate that our capital expenditures for the full fiscal year 2019 will be higher than in fiscal year 2018 due to planned spending at our manufacturing facilities We do not believe that these increased cash outflows will dramatically impact our cash position however our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise.We continually evaluate our liquidity position and anticipated cash needs as well as the financing options available to obtain additional cash reserves Our ability to fund operations to make planned capital expenditures to make scheduled debt payments and to remain in compliance with all financial covenants under debt agreements including but not limited to the current credit agreement depends on our future operating performance which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial business and other factors The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we complete may also impact our cash requirements 21CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThis discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements which have been prepared in accordance with U.S GAAP for interim financial information and in compliance with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures In preparing these financial statements we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements Estimates and assumptions are revised periodically Actual results could differ from these estimates See the information concerning our critical accounting policies included under Management s Discussion of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31 2018.ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act  as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of management including our Chief Executive Officer CEO  and Chief Financial Officer CFO  Based upon the controls evaluation our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the CEO and CFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company is engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system designed to upgrade our technology and improve our financial and operational information While the Company believes that this new system and related changes to internal controls will ultimately strengthen its internal control over financial reporting there are inherent risks in implementing a new ERP system The Company has appropriately considered these changes in its design of and testing for effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and concluded as part of the evaluation described in the above paragraph that the implementation of the new ERP in these circumstances has not materially changed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.There were no changes other than those described herein in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f under the Exchange Act that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31 2018 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management including the CEO and CFO do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud A control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control system s objectives will be met The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs Further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the Company have been detected These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks Over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 22PART II OTHER INFORMATIONItems 1A 3 and 5 of this Part II are either inapplicable or are answered in the negative and are omitted pursuant to the instructions to Part II.ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGSWe are party to various legal actions from time to time that are ordinary in nature and incidental to the operation of our business While it is not possible at this time to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits we believe that none of the pending proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows however some proceedings particularly the matters described below could have a more significant impact than others.On February 3 2015 we brought suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division against Nestl  Purina PetCare Company Nestl  seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on Nestl s alleged infringement of a patent held by us The case was stayed for approximately two years pending the Inter Partes Review IPR  discussed immediately below the stay was lifted in March 2017 and fact discovery is now complete in the case and expert discovery is currently proceeding The Court provided the parties with a claim construction decision on September 5 2018 and has set a March 18 2019 trial date.On February 14 2015 Nestl  filed a petition for the IPR with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board PTAB  of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to challenge certain of the claims in our patent The PTAB agreed to consider Nestl s petition but on June 20 2016 issued an order stating that Nestl  had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the challenged claims in our patent are unpatentable In July 2016 Nestl  filed a motion for reconsideration of the PTAB s decision which was denied in February 2017 Nestl  timely filed an appeal of the PTAB s decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit In November 2017 Nestl  filed a motion in that Court to remand the case to the PTAB for consideration of additional evidence that it claims should have been provided to the PTAB On June 11 2018 the Federal Circuit remanded the case back to the Board based on the agreement of the parties to consider an expanded record as well as for the Board to consider the previously non-instituted grounds set forth in Nestle s IPR Petition Briefing concerning these issues has now been completed and the parties are awaiting a final decision in the IPR from the Board.Due to the nature and current legal standing of the litigation with Nestl  we cannot estimate the possible damages if any and the total expense associated with the lawsuits Although no assurances can be given as to the results of the lawsuits based on the present status management does not believe that such results will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ITEM 2 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSDuring the three months ended October 31 2018 we did not sell any securities which were
