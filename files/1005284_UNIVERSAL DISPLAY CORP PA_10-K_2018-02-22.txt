materials business There number companies organizations issued patents filing patent applications relating OLED technologies materials including without limitation Kodak substantially whose OLED assets sold group LG companies 2009 CDT acquired Sumitomo 2007 Canon Inc Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co Idemitsu Kosan Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation In addition customers SDC LG Display issued patents filing patent applications relating OLED technologies materials As result may issued patents pending patent applications third parties would infringed use OLED technologies materials thus subjecting customers possible suits patent infringement future Such lawsuits could result customers liable damages require customers obtain additional licenses could increase cost products This turn

commercial usage certain claims patent infringement third parties result may incur substantial legal costs connection defending customers claims Our licensees may also seek avoid paying future royalties attempting patents declared invalid unenforceable court Our licensees may likely file declaratory actions light U.S Supreme Court decision MedImmune Inc v Genentech Inc 2007 Court found

decisions various patent cases may make difficult us obtain future patents enforce patents third parties obtain favorable judgments cases patents enforced Recent case law may make difficult patent holders secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents For example KSR International Co vs Teleflex Inc 2007 U.S Supreme Court mandated expansive flexible approach determine whether patent obvious invalid As result less rigid approach assessing obviousness defending validity obtaining patents may difficult Recent court decisions may also impact enforcement patents For example may able enjoin certain third party uses products methods covered patents following initial authorized sale even uses expressly proscribed agreement buyer Also may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement patents The U.S Supreme Court held injunction automatically issue based finding patent infringement determined based test balancing considerations patentee interest infringer interest public interest Obtaining enhanced damages willful infringement patents may also difficult even cases successfully prove third party infringed patents recent case set stringent standard proving willful infringement Therefore result rulings may difficult us defend currently issued patents obtain additional patents future achieve desired competitive effect even patents enforced If unable
