material losses.We transport certain hazardous materials materials including toxic/poisonous inhalation hazard TIH/PIH materials chlorine crude oil dangerous substances pose certain risks event release combustion Additionally United States laws impose common carrier obligations railroads require us transport certain hazardous materials regardless risk potential exposure loss A rail accident incident accident railroads facilities facilities customers involving release combustion hazardous materials could create catastrophic losses terms personal injury property damage environmental remediation costs compromise critical parts railroads In addition insurance premiums charged self-insured retention associated coverage currently maintained us could increase dramatically certain coverage may available us future catastrophic event related rail transportation materials Also federal regulators previously prescribed regulations governing railroads transportation hazardous materials ability put place additional regulations could significantly increase costs associated moving hazardous materials railroads Further certain local governments sought enact ordinances banning hazardous materials moving rail within borders Such ordinances could require re-routing hazardous materials shipments potential significant additional costs Increases costs associated transportation hazardous materials could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We may impacted inability obtain government funding capital projects benefit revenue support

without significant interruption operations could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We subject significant governmental regulation railroad operations The failure comply governmental regulations changes legislative regulatory environment could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We subject governmental regulation respect railroad operations associated new legislation executive orders issued President United States variety health safety security labor environmental regulations significant number federal state local regulatory authorities New rules regulations mandated agencies could increase operating costs For example FRA rules governing implementation interoperable positive train control system PTC amended October 2015 require compliance early December 31 2018 The FRA's rule contains certain exceptions PTC requirements Class II Class III railroads including limited excepting PTC requirements trains traveling less 20 miles PTC-required track providing Class II Class III railroads 2020 employ PTC-equipped locomotives Notwithstanding exceptions certain railroads required install PTC-related

competition interchange commitments competitive access A DOT study impacts possible increase federal truck size weight limits commenced 2012 The preliminary results DOT study released 2015 data limitations hindered changes federal truck size weight limits In 2018 expect Congress direct DOT develop research plan supplement shortcomings earlier results State departments transportation also launched initiatives seeking increase truck size weight limits state level Many actions consideration pending directed Class I railroads however various legislative regulatory initiatives considered Congress STB regulators could expand regulation railroad operations undermine economic viability certain railroads well threaten service able provide customers The cost compliance proposed rules regulations could also significant In geographies operate federal state provincial local regulatory authorities could change regulatory framework including access regimes take actions without

physical impacts attributed climate change global warming floods rising sea levels increasingly frequent intense storms alteration trade patterns individually conjunction one impacts discussed unforeseen impacts climate change could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We could incur significant costs violations liabilities environmental laws regulations.Our railroad operations real estate ownership subject extensive federal provincial state local foreign environmental laws regulations concerning among things emissions air discharges waters generation handling storage transportation disposal waste materials cleanup hazardous materials including lading petroleum releases We generate transport hazardous non-hazardous waste operations We may incur environmental liability conditions practices properties previously owned leased operated us properties owned third parties example properties hazardous substances wastes

Clean Water Act related discharge crude oil result derailment one trains November 2013 vicinity Aliceville Alabama While cleanup associated derailment substantially complete fines associated contamination yet assessed Under environmental statutes liability may found without regard whether fault may also joint several whereby responsible liability issue even though entity gives rise liability may one number entities whose conduct contributed liability.Environmental liabilities may also arise claims asserted owners occupants affected properties third parties affected environmental conditions example contractors current former employees seeking recover connection alleged damages property personal injury death and/or governmental authorities seeking remedy environmental conditions enforce environmental obligations.While maintain insurance certain environmental damages claims environmental requirements liabilities could obligate us incur significant costs expenses investigate remediate environmental contamination may may fully covered insurance Violations liabilities environmental laws regulations could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We face competition numerous sources including relating geography substitute products types transportation rail operators.In North America railroads typically rail carrier directly serving customers In certain circumstances including open access regimes Australia Europe customers direct access rail carriers In addition railroads also compete directly modes transportation principally trucks routes ship barge pipeline operators Transportation providers trucks barges utilize public rights-of-way built maintained governmental entities must build maintain network infrastructure Competition services could increase rail operators build new rail lines access certain customers grant rail carriers access rights rail lines legislation passed provides materially greater latitude trucks respect size weight restrictions automation.We also subject geographic product competition A customer could shift production region operations Also commodities transported rail could substituted another commodity transport rail For example natural gas compete coal transport fuel source electricity generation In either case could lose source revenues In addition subject import competition commodities transport face competition less expensive imported products Some products transport exported face competition global basis.29The extent competition varies significantly among railroads Competition based primarily upon rate charged relative costs substitutable products transit time required In addition competition based quality reliability service provided Because significant portion carloads United States Canada involve interchange another carrier limited control total price transit time quality service It difficult quantify potential impact competition business since customer also customer location product shipped location subject different types competition However changes competitive landscape could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.For information risks related competition associated open access regimes Australia Europe see Additional Risks Associated Foreign Operations We may adversely affected diesel fuel supply constraints resulting disruptions fuel markets increases diesel fuel costs.We consumed 71.6 million gallons diesel fuel 2017 68.0 million gallons diesel fuel 2016 Fuel availability could affected limitation fuel supply imposition mandatory allocation rationing regulations If severe fuel supply shortage arose production curtailments disruption oil imports domestic oil production disruption domestic refinery production damage refinery pipeline infrastructure political unrest war terrorist attack otherwise diesel fuel may readily available may subject rationing regulations.In addition diesel fuel costs constitute significant portion total operating expenses Currently receive fuel surcharges rate adjustments offset fuel prices although may significant delay recovery fuel costs based terms fuel surcharge program If Class I railroads change policies regarding fuel surcharges compensation receive increases fuel costs may decrease could negative effect profitability Costs fuel used operations approximately 8 7 operating expenses years ended December 31 2017 2016 respectively.If diesel fuel prices increase dramatically production curtailments disruption oil imports domestic oil production otherwise events could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.We may subject various claims lawsuits could result significant expenditures.The nature business exposes us potential various claims litigation related labor employment personal injury environmental contamination freight loss property damage contract claims matters For example United States job-related personal injury claims railroad employees subject Federal Employers Liability Act FELA applicable railroads FELA's fault-based tort system produces results unpredictable inconsistent compared no-fault worker's compensation system The variability inherent system could result actual costs claims different liability recorded From time time also various contractual disputes interchange partners customers.Any material changes current litigation trends catastrophic rail accident series accidents involving material freight loss property damage personal injury environmental liability us monetary damages associated breach contract claims covered insurance could material adverse effect results operations financial condition liquidity.30Some employees belong labor unions strikes work stoppages could adversely affect results operations financial condition liquidity.As December 31 2017 party approximately 100 collective bargaining agreements various labor unions United States Australia Canada U.K Europe We currently engaged negotiations respect approximately 27 agreements currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements five newly represented bargaining units Approximately 4,200 approximately 8,000 full time employees either union members employment terms conditions determined labor agreements negotiated labor union works council In addition 91 employees elected union representation process negotiating first collective bargaining agreement We also entered employee association agreements additional 17 employees represented national labor organization GWA six collective enterprise bargaining agreements covering majority employees In U.K Europe various collective bargaining agreements well agreements local work councils.Our inability negotiate acceptable contracts unions could result among things strikes work stoppages slowdowns affected workers If unionized workers engage strike work stoppage slowdown employees become unionized terms conditions future labor agreements renegotiated could experience significant disruption operations and/or higher ongoing labor costs A substantial majority employees Class I railroads interchange unionized If Class I railroads work slowdown strike national rail network operations would adversely affected In U.K operations reliant rail infrastructure provided Network Rail A majority Networks Rail employees unionized Network Rail work stoppage strike U.K rail network operations would adversely affected Additional unionization workforce could result higher employee compensation restrictive working condition demands could increase operating costs constrain operating flexibility.If unable employ sufficient number qualified workers results operations financial condition liquidity may materially adversely affected.We believe success growth depend upon ability attract retain skilled workers possess ability operate maintain equipment facilities The operation maintenance equipment facilities involve complex specialized processes often must performed harsh remote conditions resulting high employee turnover rate compared many industries The challenge attracting retaining necessary workforce increased expected retirement aging workforce training requirements significant competition specialized trades Within next five years estimate
