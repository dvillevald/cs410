extent customer service product quality The selling prices products fluctuate response global market conditions changes supply demand.Over last decade strong demand high capacity utilization increasing operating margins result higher global nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment nitrogen production facilities resulted increase global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity As result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased faster global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating current global oversupply market leading lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices.A significant amount new nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 first half 2017 additional production capacity expected come line second half 2017 including significant increase production capacity North America This new nitrogen production capacity includes capacity expansion projects completed 2016 affiliates General Partner The new nitrogen production capacity increase supply We expect lower priced environment continue global supply demand become balanced combination continued demand growth supply reductions producers respond lower realized margins taking higher cost production facilities
