nitrogen fertilizer prices stimulated global investment nitrogen production facilities resulted increase global nitrogen fertilizer production capacity As result global nitrogen fertilizer supply increased quickly global nitrogen fertilizer demand creating current global oversupply market leading lower nitrogen fertilizer selling prices A significant amount new nitrogen production capacity came line 2016 2017 including increase production capacity located North America increased supply We expect lower priced environment continue global supply demand become balanced combination continued demand growth supply reductions producers respond lower realized margins taking higher cost production facilities line.The U.S Gulf major global fertilizer pricing point due volume nitrogen fertilizer trades Through 2016 nitrogen pricing U.S Gulf declined often trading parity international pricing points due continued imports various exporting regions decreased North American buyer interest result greater global nitrogen supply availability Seasonal decreases agricultural demand combined delayed customer purchasing activity resulted multi-year lows nitrogen fertilizer selling prices second half 2016 During first quarter 2017 prices began increase supply demand balance tightened anticipation spring fertilizer demand planting growing season However first quarter progressed increased imports North America increased fertilizer supply region pressured selling prices downward quarter ended During second quarter 2017 anticipated demand failed materialize increased imports United States occurred first quarter 2017 continued second quarter negatively impacting selling prices During third quarter 2017 selling prices nitrogen products increased throughout quarter ending higher beginning quarter The strengthening price environment driven significantly lower Chinese exports higher energy production costs parts world including higher natural gas costs Europe higher coal costs China weaker U.S dollar strong global demand The greater global nitrogen supply availability resulting low nitrogen fertilizer selling prices significantly impacted results three nine months ended September
