principal legal regulatory requirements believe may significantly affect us.Permitting Bonding Permitting Process Cokemaking Facilities The permitting process cokemaking facilities administered individual states However main requirements obtaining environmental construction operating permits found federal regulations Once requirements satisfied state local agency produces initial draft permit Generally facility reviews comments initial draft After accepting rejecting facility comments agency typically publishes notice regarding issuance draft permit makes permit supporting documents available public review comment A public hearing may scheduled U.S Environmental Protection Agency EPA also opportunity comment draft permit The state local agency responds comments draft permit may make revisions final construction permit issued A construction permit allows construction commencement operations facility generally valid least 18 months Generally construction commences period many states allow period extended certain situations Air Quality Our cokemaking facilities employ Maximum Available Control Technology MACT standards designed limit emissions certain hazardous air pollutants Specific MACT standards apply door leaks charging oven pressure pushing quenching Certain MACT standards new cokemaking facilities developed using test data SunCoke's Jewell cokemaking
