Protection Allstate brand and Esurance Service Businesses Allstate Benefits and Allstate Life The increase in revenue is partially offset by net realized capital losses compared to net realized capital gains in the prior period and lower net investment income.Net Investment Income in millions)Net investment income decreased 8.1 and 2.1 in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 respectively compared to the prior periods primarily due to lower performance-based investment results compared to strong 2017 performance-based results as well as higher expenses partially offset by

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Tax Legislation  became effective permanently reducing the U.S corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning January 1 2018 As a result the corporate tax rate is not comparable between periods During 2017 we revalued deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded liabilities related to the transition to the modified territorial system for international taxation The impact of the Tax Legislation may differ from our preliminary estimates due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Legislation During the period ended June 30 2018 we have not recorded any material adjustments to these provisional amounts We continue to refine our analysis and calculations which could impact the provisional estimates previously recorded Accordingly as of June 30 2018 we have not fully completed our accounting for the Tax Legislation.We are utilizing a portion of the benefits from the Tax Legislation for the following initiatives Accelerating growth initiatives Enhancing our employee value proposition including investing in employee training programs Improving local communities Increasing cash returns to shareholders by increasing our target quarterly dividend per common shareIn the first quarter of 2018 employees received either 1,000 or 2,000 of Choice Dollars Choice Dollars  following a reduction in the federal tax rate which could be taken as a cash bonus or contributed to a 401(k or health savings account 43 million was recorded as an expense with 21 million recorded in claims and claim expense and 22 million recorded in other costs and expenses The expenses associated with these initiatives will occur throughout 2018 and certain costs will reoccur in future periods.Investments totaled 83.24 billion as of June 30 2018 increasing from 82.80 billion as of December 31 2017.Shareholders  equity As of June 30 2018 shareholders  equity was 23.12 billion This total included 3.42 billion in deployable assets at the parent holding company level comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter.Book value per diluted common share ratio of common shareholders  equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares outstanding was 59.16 as of June 30 2018 an

reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in realized capital gains and losses Limited partnerships previously reported using the cost method are now reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net investment income See the Investments section of this Item for further details.Revenue from Contracts with Customers Beginning January 1 2018 we adopted the revenue from contracts with customers accounting standard which revises the criteria for revenue recognition and impacted the Service Businesses segment by increasing deferred revenue by approximately 160 million with a corresponding increase in DAC for protection plans that are sold directly to retailers The anticipated impact of these adjustments offset and do not impact net income but impact premium and DAC comparability trends as they are recognized over the life of the policy.See Note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the adopted accounting standards.Other Revenue Presentation Concurrent with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s standard on revenue from contracts with customers and our objective of providing more information related to revenues for our Service Businesses we revised the presentation of total revenue to include other revenue Previously components of other revenue were presented within operating costs and expenses and primarily represent fees collected from policyholders relating to premium installment payments commissions on sales of non-proprietary products fee-based services and other revenue transactions Other revenue is recognized when performance obligations are fulfilled Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current separate presentation of other revenue.Second

Property-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.We do not allocate Property-Liability investment income realized capital gains and losses or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the ratio of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the ratio of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined ratio the ratio of amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned Amortization of purchased

restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 51Property-Liability OperationsSummarized financial data Three months ended June 30 Six months ended June 30 in

Allstate ProtectionCatastrophe losses were 906 million and 1.27 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 respectively including 37 million for anticipated TWIA assessments related to Hurricane Harvey see Note 12 of the condensed consolidated financial statements compared to 993 million and 1.77 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2017 respectively We define a catastrophe  as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of 1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area occurring within a certain amount of time following the event Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds winter storms and freezes tornadoes hailstorms wildfires tropical storms tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.Loss estimates are generally based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors Our loss estimates are calculated in accordance with the coverage provided by our policies Auto policyholders generally have coverage for physical damage due to flood if they have purchased optional auto comprehensive coverage Our homeowners policies specifically exclude coverage for losses caused by flood Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes through reinsurance and changes in underwriting guidelines

Our catastrophe reinsurance program supports our goal to have no more than a 1 likelihood of exceeding average annual aggregate catastrophe losses by 2 billion net of reinsurance from hurricanes and earthquakes based on modeled assumptions and applications currently used Our program provides reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes windstorms hail tornadoes earthquakes fires following earthquakes riots freeze and wildfires These reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our personal lines business and to reduce variability of earnings while providing protection to our customers During the second quarter of 2018 we completed the Florida component of the program that is designed to address the distinct needs of our separately capitalized companies in that state Our 2018 Florida program provides 667 million of reinsurance limits per occurrence subject to a 20 million retention The Florida program includes reinsurance agreements placed with the traditional market the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund FHCF  and the Insurance Linked Securities ILS  market as follows The traditional market placement comprises 285 million of reinsurance limits for losses to personal lines property in Florida arising out of multiple perils The 2018 Excess contract which forms a part of the traditional market placement with 249 million of limits subject to a 20 million retention provides coverage for perils not covered by the FHCF contracts which only cover hurricanes The FHCF contracts provide 90 of 180 million of reinsurance limits or approximately 162 million of limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by storms the National Hurricane Center declares to be hurricanes The ILS placement provides 200 million of reinsurance limits for qualifying losses to personal lines property in Florida caused by a named storm event a severe thunderstorm event an earthquake event a wildfire event a volcanic eruption event or a meteorite impact event.We also placed the Aggregate Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract Automobile Florida and Southeast States in the second quarter of 2018 The Aggregate Excess Catastrophe Florida and Southeast States Automobile contract provides 90 of 250 million of reinsurance limits for losses to personal and commercial lines automobile business physical damage only arising out of multiple perils provided such losses arise out of a catastrophe and result in covered qualifying losses in the state of Florida If losses are incurred in the state of Florida coverage is also provided for losses to personal lines and commercial lines automobile business physical damage only arising out of that same catastrophe and occurring in Alabama Georgia Louisiana Mississippi North Carolina and/or South Carolina The 250 million of reinsurance limits are subject to a 250 million aggregate retention for losses arising out of one or all qualifying catastrophes commencing during the contract s one year term.For a

year reserve reestimates partially offset by higher claim severity Frequency and severity statistics which are influenced by driving patterns inflation and other factors are provided to describe the trends in loss costs of the business Our reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns operational statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to determine our best estimate of recorded reserves We use the following statistics to evaluate losses Paid claim frequency 1 is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of PIF with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency 1 is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of PIF with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed with a payment or closed without payment Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period Percent change in frequency or severity statistics is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency or severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency or severity 1 Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events.Second Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 65Segment Results Allstate Protection Allstate brandPaid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect smaller differences as timing between opening and settlement is generally less For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity We are continuing to aggressively seek new technology and process solutions to provide continued loss cost accuracy efficient processing and enhanced customer experiences that are simple fast and produce high degrees of satisfaction For example we have opened several Digital Operating Centers to handle auto claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation capabilities which includes estimating damage through photos and video with the use of QuickFoto Claim  and Virtual AssistSM These organizational and process changes have been beneficial to our operations as they are occurring but frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as changes in claim opening and closing practices if any can impact

income Portfolio composition by investment strategy We utilize two primary strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-based core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-based active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk primarily through investments in private equity and real estate.88 www.allstate.comInvestments Portfolio composition by investment strategy As of June 30 2018 in millions Market-based core Market-based active Performance-based

insurance coverage needs Other key factors that may impact the likelihood of customer surrender include the level of the contract surrender charge the length of time the contract has been in force distribution channel market interest rates equity market conditions and potential tax implications In addition the propensity for retail life insurance policies to lapse is lower than it is for fixed annuities because of the need for the insured to be re-underwritten upon policy replacement The annualized surrender and partial withdrawal rate on deferred fixed annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products based on the beginning of year contractholder funds was 7.3 and 6.1 in the first six months of 2018 and 2017 respectively We strive to promptly pay customers who request cash
