development Phase I bioequivalence studies compare future Established Pharmaceutical's brand already marketed compound active pharmaceutical ingredient API Phase II studies test efficacy benefits small group patients Phase III studies broaden testing wider population reflects actual medical use Phase IV post-marketing studies obtain new clinical use data existing products within approved indications The specific requirements e.g scope clinical trials obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries geographic regions The process may range one year bioequivalence study project 6 years complex formulations new indications geographic expansion specific countries China 38 In Diagnostics segment phases research development process include Discovery focuses
