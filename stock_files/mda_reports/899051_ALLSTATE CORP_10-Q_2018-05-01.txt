Property-Liability Operations and Segment Results sections including Allstate Protection Service Businesses Allstate Life Allstate Benefits and Allstate Annuities of Management s Discussion and Analysis MD&A  The segments are consistent with the way in which the chief operating decision maker reviews financial performance and makes decisions about the allocation of resources Measuring segment profit or lossThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments and adjusted net income for the Service Businesses Allstate Life Allstate Benefits Allstate Annuities and Corporate and Other segments Underwriting income is calculated as premiums earned and other revenue less claims and claims expense losses  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs DAC  operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP  We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze the profitability of the Property-Liability insurance operations separately from investment results Underwriting income is reconciled to net income applicable to common shareholders in the Property-Liability Operations section of Management s Discussion and Analysis MD&A  Adjusted net income is net income applicable to common shareholders excluding Realized capital gains and losses after-tax except for periodic settlements and accruals on non-hedge derivative instruments which are reported with realized capital gains and losses but included in adjusted net income  Valuation changes on embedded derivatives not hedged after-tax  Amortization of DAC and deferred sales inducement costs DSI  to the extent they resulted from the recognition of certain realized capital gains and losses or valuation changes on embedded derivatives not hedged

capital gains in the prior period The Property-Liability combined ratio was 88.0 compared to 92.9.Total Revenue in billions)First quarter 2018 vs 2017  Increase was primarily due to higher Allstate Protection insurance premiums and higher net investment income partially offset by net realized capital losses compared to net realized capital gains in the prior period Net Investment Income in millions)First quarter 2018 vs 2017  The increase benefited from performance-based investment results primarily from limited partnerships partially offset by lower market-based portfolio income and higher expenses Segment HighlightsAllstate Protection underwriting income totaled 962 million in the first quarter of 2018 a 74.9 increase from 550 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower catastrophe losses increased premiums earned and lower claim frequency partially offset by higher operating costs and expenses higher claim severity and lower favorable prior year reserve reestimates Premiums written increased 5.0 to 7.84 billion Service Businesses adjusted net loss was 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 10 million in the first quarter of 2017 The improvement was primarily due to improved loss experience at SquareTrade partially offset by investments in research and business expansion at Arity Total revenues increased 26.7 to 313 million Net investment income increased 66.7 to 5 million Allstate Life adjusted net income was 69 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 59 million in the first quarter of 2017 The increase was

to 327 million.Allstate Benefits adjusted net income was 28 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 22 million in the first quarter of 2017 The increase was primarily due to higher premiums and contract charges partially offset by higher contract benefits Premiums and contract charges increased 6.3 to 286 million.Allstate Annuities adjusted net income was 35 million in 2018 compared to

Legislation  became effective permanently reducing the U.S corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 beginning January 1 2018 The decrease in the effective tax rate will impact the comparative trends We anticipate utilizing a portion of the benefits from the Tax Legislation for the following initiatives Accelerate growth initiatives Further enhance our employee value proposition Improve local communities Increase our target quarterly dividend per common shareThe expenses associated with these initiatives will occur throughout 2018 and certain costs will reoccur in future periods.Investment in our people In the first quarter of 2018 employees received either 1,000 or 2,000 of Choice Dollars Choice Dollars  following a reduction in the federal tax rate which could be taken as a cash bonus or contributed to a 401(k or health savings account 43 million was recorded as an expense with 21 million recorded in claims and claim expense and 22 million recorded in other costs and expenses We expect these costs to reoccur as a component of our compensation costs in future years.Investments totaled 83.29 billion as of March 31 2018 increasing from 82.80 billion as of December 31 2017.Shareholders  equity As of March 31 2018 shareholders  equity was 23.28 billion This total included 3.86 billion in deployable assets at the parent holding company level comprising cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter.Book value per diluted common share ratio of common shareholders  equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares outstanding was 58.64 as of March 31 2018 an increase of 11.9 from 52.41 as of March 31 2017 and an increase of 1.8 from 57.58 as of December 31 2017.Return on average common shareholders  equity For the twelve months ended March 31 2018 return on the average of beginning and ending period common shareholders  equity of 16.6 increased by 5.0 points from 11.6 for the twelve months ended March 31 2017 Adopted Accounting Standards Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities recognition and measurement accounting standard  Beginning January 1 2018 equity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in realized capital gains and losses Limited partnerships previously reported using the cost method are now reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net investment income See the Investments section of this Item for further details related to the adoption.Revenue from Contracts with Customers Beginning January 1 2018 we adopted the revenue from contracts with customers accounting standard which revises the criteria for revenue recognition and impacted the Service Businesses segment by increasing deferred revenue by approximately 160 million with a corresponding increase in DAC for protection plans that are sold directly to retailers The anticipated impacts of these adjustments offset and will not impact net income but will impact premiums and DAC comparability trends as they are recognized over the life of the policy See Note 1 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details on the adopted accounting standards.Other revenue presentation Concurrent with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB  standard on revenue from contracts with customers and our objective of providing more information related to revenues for our Services Businesses we revised the presentation of total revenue to include other revenue Previously components of other revenue were presented within operating costs and expenses and primarily represent fees collected from policyholders relating to premium installment payments commissions on sales of non-proprietary products fee-based services and other revenue transactions Other revenue is recognized when performance obligations are fulfilled Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current separate presentation of other revenue.First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 43Consolidated Net Income Three months ended March 31 in millions 2018 2017Revenues Property-liability insurance

OperationsProperty-Liability OperationsOverview Our Property-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.We do not allocate Property-Liability investment income realized capital gains and losses or assets to the Allstate Protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes The table below includes GAAP operating ratios we use to measure our profitability We believe that they enhance an investor s understanding of our profitability They are calculated as follows Loss ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense to premiums earned Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses Expense ratio the ratio of amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned Combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense amortization of DAC operating costs and expenses and restructuring and related charges less other revenue to premiums earned The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio The difference between 100 and the combined ratio represents underwriting income as a percentage of premiums earned or underwriting margin We have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between fiscal periods Effect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio the ratio of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio the ratio of prior year reserve reestimates included in claims and claims expense to premiums earned This ratio includes prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses Effect of amortization of purchased intangible assets on combined ratio the ratio of amortization of purchased intangible assets to premiums earned Amortization of purchased intangible assets is reported in operating costs and expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Effect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio the ratio of restructuring and related charges to premiums earned Effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on combined ratio the ratio of claims and claims expense and operating costs and expenses in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment to Property-Liability premiums earned The sum of the effect of Discontinued Lines and Coverages on the combined ratio and the Allstate Protection combined ratio is equal to the Property-Liability combined ratio.First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 45Property-Liability OperationsSummarized financial data Three months ended March

first quarter of 2018 compared to 781 million in the first quarter of 2017 Catastrophe losses in first quarter 2017 were impacted by higher than historical first quarter catastrophe losses Loss estimates are generally based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors Our loss estimates are calculated in accordance with the coverage provided by our policies Auto policyholders generally have coverage for physical damage due to flood if they have purchased optional auto comprehensive coverage Our homeowners policies specifically exclude coverage for losses caused by flood Over time we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes through reinsurance and underwriting guidelines limited by our participation in various state facilities We define a catastrophe  as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of 1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area occurring within a certain amount of time following the event Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds winter storms and freezes tornadoes hailstorms wildfires tropical storms tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes and volcanoes We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events such as certain types of terrorism or industrial accidents The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.Catastrophe losses by the size of event Three months ended March 31 2018 in millions Number of events Claims and claims expense Combinedratioimpact Average

Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract Automobile Florida and Southeast States that are expected to be placed in the second quarter of 2018 we have substantially completed the placement of our 2018 catastrophe reinsurance program Similar to our 2017 program our 2018 program includes coverage for losses to personal lines property and automobile arising out of multiple perils in addition to hurricanes and earthquakes in all agreements except for two agreements placed in the insurance linked securities ILS  market forming part of our nationwide reinsurance program and the Kentucky agreement.The June 1 2018 nationwide reinsurance program excluding New Jersey and property business in the state of Florida where separate reinsurance agreements address the distinct needs of our separately capitalized legal entities in these states provides 4.5 billion of reinsurance limits less a 500 million retention subject to the percentage of reinsurance placed in each of its nine layers The nationwide reinsurance program includes reinsurance agreements with both the traditional and ILS markets as described below 50 www.allstate.comAllstate Protection Segment Results The traditional market placement provides limits totaling 2.6 billion for losses arising out of multiple perils and is comprised of 2.1 billion of limits with one annual reinstatement of limits 439 million of limits with one reinstatement of limits over a seven year term and 69 million of limits not subject to reinstatement.ILS placements provide 1.2 billion of limits with no reinstatement of the limits and are comprised of a 305 million placement reinsuring losses in certain states caused by hurricanes earthquakes and fire following earthquakes with amounts payable based on insured industry losses and further adjusted to account for our exposures in reinsured areas 375 million placement reinsuring losses in all states except Florida and New Jersey caused by named storms earthquakes and fire following earthquakes severe thunderstorms winter storms volcanic eruptions and meteorite impacts and a 500 million placement reinsuring losses in all states except Florida and New Jersey caused by named storms earthquakes and fire following earthquakes severe weather wildfires and other naturally occurring or man-made events determined to be a catastrophe by the Company The 500 million placement also provides coverage on two or more events that can be aggregated to erode the aggregate retention and qualify for coverage under the aggregate limit Recoveries are limited to our ultimate net loss from the reinsured event The New Jersey agreement comprises three contracts that reinsure personal lines property and automobile catastrophe losses caused by multiple perils in New Jersey and provides 95 of 400 million of limits excess of provisional retentions of approximately 144 million Each contract includes one annual reinstatement of limits.The Kentucky Earthquake agreement comprises a three-year term contract that reinsures personal lines property losses caused by earthquakes and fire following earthquakes in Kentucky and provides 28 million of limits in excess of a 2 million retention.The total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs during the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 were 85 million and 93 million respectively The decrease is related to lower costs in Allstate brand homeowners partially offset by costs related to Aggregate Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Contract Automobile Florida and Southeast States that became effective on June 1 2017 The

earned lower catastrophe losses and lower claim frequency partially offset by higher claim severity Frequency and severity statistics which are influenced by driving patterns inflation and other factors are provided to describe the trends in loss costs of the business Our reserving process incorporates changes in loss patterns operational statistics and changes in claims reporting processes to determine our best estimate of recorded reserves.Paid claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts closed with payment in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency is calculated as annualized notice counts received in the period divided by the average of policies in force with the applicable coverage during the period Gross claim frequency includes all actual notice counts regardless of their current status open or closed or their ultimate disposition closed with a payment or closed without payment Frequency statistics exclude counts associated with catastrophe events The percent change in paid or gross claim frequency is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in the paid or gross claim frequency in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid or gross claim frequency Paid claim frequency trends will often differ from gross claim frequency trends due to differences in the timing of when notices are received and when claims are settled For property damage claims paid frequency trends reflect smaller differences as timing between opening and settlement is generally less For bodily injury gross frequency trends reflect emerging trends since the difference in timing between opening and settlement is much greater and gross frequency does not experience the same volatility in quarterly fluctuations seen in paid frequency In evaluating frequency we typically rely upon paid frequency trends for physical damage coverages such as property damage and gross frequency for casualty coverages such as bodily injury to provide an indicator of emerging trends in overall claim frequency while also providing insights for our analysis of severity Paid claim severity is calculated by dividing the sum of paid losses and loss expenses by claims closed with a payment during the period The percent change in paid claim severity is calculated as the amount of increase or decrease in paid claim severity in the current period compared to the same period in the prior year divided by the prior year paid claims severity.We are continuing to aggressively seek new technology and process solutions to provide continued loss cost accuracy efficient processing and enhanced customer experiences that are simple fast and produce high degrees of satisfaction For example we have opened several Digital Operating Centers to handle auto claims countrywide utilizing our virtual estimation capabilities which includes estimating damage through photos and video with the use of QuickFoto Claim  and Virtual AssistSM These organizational and process changes have been beneficial to our operations as they are occurring but frequency and severity statistics may be impacted as changes in claim opening and closing practices if any can impact comparisons to prior periods Property damage paid claim frequency decreased 3.0 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 38 states experienced a year over year decrease in property damage paid claim frequency in first quarter 2018 when compared to first quarter 2017 Property damage paid claim severities increased 4.7 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to higher costs to repair more sophisticated newer model vehicles and increased volume of total losses Bodily injury gross claim frequency decreased 2.0 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 Bodily injury paid claim frequency decreased 15.2 while bodily injury paid claim severity increased 15.8 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 Claim process changes in the second half of 2016 related to enhanced documentation of injuries and related medical treatments are having a related impact on paid claim frequency and severity due to payment mix and claim closure patterns These process changes and the related impacts on the percent change in paid claim frequency and severity have begun to moderate but are still impacting comparative trends.First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q 57Segment Results

in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 Paid claim severity excluding catastrophe losses increased 14.4 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017

strategy We utilize two primary strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects As strategies and market conditions evolve the asset allocation may change or assets may be moved between strategies.Market-based strategies include investments primarily in public fixed income and equity securities Market-based core seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and returns consistent with the markets in which we invest Private fixed income assets such as commercial mortgages bank loans and privately placed debt that provide liquidity premiums are also included in this category Market-based active seeks to outperform within the public markets through tactical positioning and by taking advantage of short-term opportunities This category may generate results that meaningfully deviate from those achieved by market indices both favorably and unfavorably.Performance-based strategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk primarily through investments in private equity and real
