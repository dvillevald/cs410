plans Severe financial difficulties major suppliers could material adverse effect us unable obtain timely basis similar economic terms quantity quality components require produce products.Moreover severe financial operating difficulties automotive commercial truck off-highway vehicle manufacturer supplier could significant disruptive effect entire industry leading supply chain disruptions labor unrest among things These disruptions could force original equipment manufacturers turn suppliers including us shut production plants While issues customers suppliers face economic difficulties may primarily financial nature difficulties inability meet increased demand conditions recover could also result supply chain disruptions.We subject could subject investigations antitrust regulators
