recycled fiber use four five containerboard mills well containerboard machine Wallula Washington mill In 2016 purchased approximately 630,000 tons recycled fiber net recycled fiber generated corrugated box plants The amount recycled fiber purchased year varies based upon production prices recycled fiber wood fiber Periods supply demand imbalance created significant price volatility Periods higher recycled fiber costs unusual price volatility occurred past may occur future could result higher costs lower earnings A 10 per ton price increase recycled fiber containerboard mills would result approximately 6 million additional expense Cost Purchased Fuels Chemicals An increase cost purchased fuels chemicals could lead higher manufacturing costs resulting reduced earnings We
