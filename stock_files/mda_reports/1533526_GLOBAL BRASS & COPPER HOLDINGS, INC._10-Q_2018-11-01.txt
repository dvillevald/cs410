CONDITIONAND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion analysis financial condition results operations read conjunction consolidated financial statements related notes included elsewhere Quarterly Report Form 10-Q Annual Report Form 10-K year ended December 31 2017 In addition historical data discussion contains forward-looking statements business operations financial performance based current expectations involve risks uncertainties assumptions Our actual results may differ materially discussed forward-looking statements result various factors including limited discussed section entitled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere Quarterly Report Form 10-Q.OverviewOur CompanyGlobal Brass Copper Holdings Inc Holdings GBC Company us incorporated Delaware October 10 2007 We commenced commercial operations November 19 2007 following acquisition metals business Olin Corporation.We leading value-added converter fabricator processor distributor specialized non-ferrous products including wide range sheet strip foil rod tube fabricated metal component products While primarily process copper copper alloys also reroll form certain metals stainless steel carbon steel aluminum Using processed scrap virgin metals refined metals engage metal melting casting rolling drawing extruding welding stamping fabricate finished semi-finished alloy products Key attributes copper copper alloys conductivity corrosion resistance strength malleability cosmetic appearance bactericidal properties.Unlike traditional metals companies particularly engage mining smelting refining activities purely metal converter fabricator processor distributor attempt generate profits fluctuations metal prices Our financial performance primarily driven metal conversion economics underlying movements price copper metals use Through balanced book approach strive match timing quantity price metal sales timing quantity price replacement metal purchases This practice along toll processing operations last-in first-out LIFO inventory accounting methodology substantially eliminates financial impact fluctuating metal commodity prices earnings operating margins.Our products used variety applications across diversified markets including building housing munitions automotive transportation coinage electronics electrical components industrial machinery equipment signage general consumer markets We access markets direct mill sales captive distribution network third-party distributors We hold exclusive production distribution rights North America lead-free brass rod product sell Green Dot Eco Brass brand names We believe domestic copper brass sheet manufacturer captive distribution service center operations competitive advantage allows us
