truck off-highway applications generated revenues 9.3 billion 2017 We serve original equipment manufacturers OEMs replacement markets worldwide leading brands including Monroe Rancho Clevite Elastomers Axios Kinetic Fric-Rot ride performance products Walker XNOx Fonos DynoMax Thrush clean air products.As parts supplier produce individual component parts vehicles well groups components combined modules systems within vehicles These parts modules systems sold globally leading OEMs commercial truck off-highway engine manufacturers aftermarket distribution channels.Overview Parts Industry Vehicles EnginesThe parts industry vehicles engines generally separated two categories 1 original equipment OE parts sold large quantities directly use manufacturers light vehicles commercial trucks off-highway engines 2 aftermarket replacement parts sold varying quantities wholesalers retailers installers In OE category parts suppliers generally divided tiers Tier 1 suppliers provide products directly OEMs Tier 2 Tier 3 suppliers sell products principally suppliers combination suppliers product offerings Light vehicles comprised 1 passenger cars 2 light trucks include sport-utility vehicles SUVs crossover vehicles CUVs pick-up trucks vans multi-purpose passenger vehicles Demand OE light vehicle automotive parts generally function number new vehicles produced turn depends prevailing economic conditions consumer preferences Although OE demand tied planned vehicle production parts suppliers also opportunity grow revenues increasing product content per vehicle expanding business existing customers serving new customers existing new markets Companies global presence advanced technology engineering manufacturing support capabilities company better positioned

environmental standards adopted around world We continue expand investment around world regions North America Europe China India Japan capitalize growing demand environmentally friendly solutions light vehicle commercial truck off-highway applications driven environmental regulations regions.To meet stricter air quality regulations developed sold diesel particulate filters DPFs Europe example Audi A4 BMW 1 series passenger cars Scania trucks North America GM Duramax engine applications Ford Super Duty Chrysler Ram Heavy Duty off-highway applications Caterpillar John Deere North America Europe Kubota Japan These particulate filters coupled converters reduce emissions particulate matter 90 percent In addition development production contracts selective catalytic reduction SCR systems light commercial vehicle manufacturers These SCR systems reduce emissions nitrogen oxides 95 percent In China South America Europe Japan development production contracts complete turnkey SCR systems include urea dosing technology acquired 2007 sold globally name XNOx Regulations U.S European markets require reductions carbon dioxide emissions improvements fuel economy creating increased demand fabricated manifolds maniverters integrated turbocharger/manifold modules electronic exhaust valves lightweight components Lastly various off-highway customers offer emission aftertreatment systems designed meet environmental regulations equivalent outside U.S Both commercial truck off-highway customers embracing concept turnkey aftertreatment systems require aftertreatment electronic control units ECUs well related control software developed sold several customers.Increasing Technologically Sophisticated ContentAs end users consumers continue demand vehicles improved performance safety
